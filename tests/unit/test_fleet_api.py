"""The fleet routes — ordering, and what starting an agent refuses (tasks 5.8, 6.1).

**This file exists because its own absence was a defect.** `api/fleet.py`'s
docstring stated that "the unit test `test_fleet_api.py` fails if that ordering
is lost" while no such file existed — a guard asserted in prose and held by
nothing. The claim is now true.

The ordering it guards (finding CB-16) is not cosmetic: the dashboard serves 53
`/api/{project}/...` routes, FastAPI resolves in registration order, and a
wildcard registered first answers `/api/fleet/agents` as a project named
"fleet" — a 200 with the wrong body, which is worse than a 404.
