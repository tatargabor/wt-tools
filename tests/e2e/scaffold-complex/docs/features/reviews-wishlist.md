│ ★★★★★  "The best coffee of my life"                     │

│ This was my first time ordering specialty coffee and     │
│ I was completely blown away. The floral aroma is         │
│ noticeable right from grinding, and the cup tastes       │
│ like pure jasmine tea. I love it!                        │

│ ★★★☆☆  "Good, but not my favorite"                     │
│ Jane Doe — 2026-03-05                                    │

│ Quality coffee, but a bit too acidic for my taste.       │
│ I prefer the Brazil Cerrado style. The shipping was      │
│ fast though, arrived the next day.                       │
