# ─── Planning Prompt Templates ─────────────────────────────────────────

# Shared rules block used by both spec-mode and brief-mode
_PLANNING_RULES = """Rules:
- Each change should be completable in 1 Ralph loop session (not too large, not too granular)
- Use kebab-case names (e.g., add-user-auth, refactor-payment-flow)
- Define dependencies: if change B needs code from change A, list A in depends_on
- Changes with no dependencies can run in parallel
- Complexity: S (< 8 tasks, preferred), M (8-15 tasks, maximum). L (15+ tasks) is NOT ALLOWED — split into smaller changes.
- Max 6 requirements per change. If a feature domain has more than 6 requirements, split it into sub-domain changes.
- Scope text should be 800-1500 chars. If you need more than 2000 chars to describe a change, it is too large — split it.
- Skip already-active changes listed above
- Every change scope MUST include specific test requirements (happy path, error cases, security boundaries)
- For security-related changes: include tenant isolation tests, auth guard tests
- If no test infrastructure exists, the FIRST change MUST be "test-infrastructure-setup" setting up the test framework, config, helpers, and an example test. ALL other changes MUST depend on it.
- If test infrastructure exists, follow existing test patterns (framework and naming conventions noted above)
- NEVER create a standalone "e2e-consolidation", "playwright-e2e", or "e2e-tests" change that only writes E2E tests. This anti-pattern overloads one agent with all cross-feature tests and wastes tokens. Each feature change MUST include its OWN E2E tests inline.

Sub-domain dependency chaining:
- When splitting a large feature domain into multiple changes, those changes MUST form a depends_on chain (sequential execution within the domain)
- Different domain chains can still run in parallel with each other
- Example: splitting "product-catalog" (22 reqs) into product-list → product-detail → product-search — each depends_on the previous, but all can run in parallel with an unrelated "user-auth" chain

Split heuristics for common patterns:
- List page + detail page → split into separate changes if combined requirements exceed 6
- CRUD operations → separate from read-only views when the domain is large
- Search/filtering with its own API routes → separate change
- Auth + profile + password management → split auth/login from profile/account management

Dependency ordering heuristics — classify each change by type and apply ordering:
- Classify each change as one of: infrastructure (test/build setup, CI), schema (DB migrations, model changes), foundational (auth, shared types, base components), feature (new functionality), cleanup-before (refactor/rename/reorganize existing code), cleanup-after (dead code removal, cosmetic fixes)
- infrastructure changes run first — all others depend on them
- schema/migration changes run before data-layer or API changes that use those tables
- foundational changes (auth, shared types) run before features that consume them
- cleanup-before/refactor changes run before feature changes that touch the same area (e.g., a UI cleanup should complete before new UI features are built on that code)
- cleanup-after changes run last — they depend on the features they clean up around
- If the spec contains explicit dependency hints (e.g., "depends_on: X", "requires X", "after X is complete"), preserve them in the output depends_on array

Shared resource awareness:
- If 2+ parallel changes would likely modify the same shared file (conventions docs, shared types, config files, common UI components), chain them via depends_on to prevent merge conflicts
- Prefer serialization over parallel execution when shared files are involved
- Common shared resources: design/convention docs, shared type definitions, package.json, layout components

Test-per-change requirement:
- Each change that adds a user-facing route, feature, or API endpoint MUST include its own tests. Do NOT defer all testing to a final "e2e" change.
- The quality gate BLOCKS changes without test files for feature/infrastructure types.
- Explicitly list test files in scope (e.g., "Tests: Create orders.test.ts").

Playwright E2E test planning (when e2e_command is configured):
- The infrastructure/foundation change (first in dependency order) MUST set up Playwright alongside Jest:
  * Create playwright.config.ts with PW_PORT env var support and webServer auto-start
  * Add testPathIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/", "/tests/e2e/"] to jest.config (Jest crashes on Playwright .spec.ts imports in jsdom)
  * Add @playwright/test to devDependencies + run npx playwright install chromium
  * Create tests/e2e/global-setup.ts: prisma generate → prisma db push --force-reset → prisma db seed
- Each subsequent feature change creating a user-facing route MUST create tests/e2e/<feature>.spec.ts as an explicit file deliverable in scope (e.g., "Create tests/e2e/cart.spec.ts")
- Include CONCRETE test scenarios per feature:
  * Page URL to visit
  * User interactions: what to click, what data to type, what to select
  * Expected outcomes: visible text, redirects, error messages
  * Auth scenarios: verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users
  * Error scenarios: invalid form input, missing required fields
  * COLD-VISIT test: navigate directly to the page as the FIRST action (no prior login, no add-to-cart, no session cookie). This catches Server Component cookie/session bugs where cookies().set() crashes outside a Server Action.
- Example scope:
  Create tests/e2e/orders.spec.ts:
  - Cold visit: go to /cart directly (no prior actions) → should show empty state, NOT crash
  - Visit /products → click "Add to Cart" on first product → cart badge shows "1"
  - Visit /cart → verify product name and price → click "Checkout" → fill form → verify redirect to /orders/[id]
  - Visit /admin/orders without login → verify redirect to /admin/login
- Do NOT defer all E2E tests to a consolidation change — this overloads a single agent. Each feature change owns its tests.
- Do NOT just list "Functional test scenarios:" as descriptions — create actual test files.
- E2E tests run pre-merge in the worktree via e2e_command against an auto-started dev server with isolated port and DB.

Model selection — suggest a model per change based on task nature:
- "opus" for ALL changes that write functional code (features, bug fixes, refactors, cleanup, tests)
- "sonnet" ONLY for doc-only changes (doc sync, doc audit, README updates) — zero code writing
- Sonnet cannot follow OpenSpec workflows, make architecture decisions, or write quality code
- When in doubt, always use "opus"

Manual tasks — flag changes that require human intervention:
- Set "has_manual_tasks": true when a change involves: external API keys/secrets (Stripe, AWS, Firebase), third-party account/project creation, OAuth app registration, DNS configuration, webhook setup, or any step that cannot be automated
- Examples: "integrate Stripe payments" (needs API key), "set up Firebase auth" (needs project creation), "configure custom domain" (needs DNS records)
- When false or omitted, all tasks are assumed automatable"""

_DIGEST_FIELDS = """Digest-mode additional requirements:
- Each change MUST include "spec_files": an array of raw spec file paths (relative to spec base dir) that this change needs for implementation. These files will be copied into the worktree.
- Each change MUST include "requirements": an array of REQ-* IDs from the digest that this change owns and implements.
- If a change must incorporate a cross-cutting requirement owned by another change, list it in "also_affects_reqs" (not in "requirements").
- Every non-removed REQ-* ID in the digest MUST appear in exactly one change's "requirements" array. Cross-cutting requirements appear in one change's "requirements" (primary owner) and other changes' "also_affects_reqs"."""
