# ─── Planning Prompt Templates ─────────────────────────────────────────

# Core planning rules (framework-agnostic) — web-specific Playwright block
# moved to wt-project-web/planning_rules.txt, loaded via profile.planning_rules()
_PLANNING_RULES_CORE = """Rules:
- Each change should be completable in 1 Ralph loop session (not too large, not too granular)
- Use kebab-case names (e.g., add-user-auth, refactor-payment-flow)
- Define dependencies: if change B needs code from change A, list A in depends_on
- Changes with no dependencies can run in parallel
- Complexity: S (< 8 tasks, preferred), M (8-15 tasks, maximum). L (15+ tasks) is NOT ALLOWED — split into smaller changes.
- Max 6 requirements per change. If a feature domain has more than 6 requirements, split it into sub-domain changes.
- Scope text should be 800-1500 chars. If you need more than 2000 chars to describe a change, it is too large — split it.
- Skip already-active changes listed above
- Every change scope MUST include specific test requirements (happy path, error cases, security boundaries)
- For security-related changes: include tenant isolation tests, auth guard tests

Security design patterns — include these constraints in scope when the change handles user data or access control:
- Authorization on mutations: every data mutation (update, delete) by client-provided ID MUST include an ownership check (scope the query by the authenticated user/session). NEVER trust client-provided IDs alone.
- Access control: protected resources MUST enforce auth checks before the handler runs. Explicitly name the auth guard/middleware in scope.
- Input validation: public-facing entry points (API routes, form handlers, CLI args) MUST validate all parameters at the boundary. Reject invalid types, out-of-range values, and oversized inputs.
- Data scoping: multi-tenant/multi-user features MUST scope ALL queries by the owning entity, not just create operations.
- If no test infrastructure exists, the FIRST change MUST be "test-infrastructure-setup" setting up the test framework, config, helpers, and an example test. ALL other changes MUST depend on it.
- If test infrastructure exists, follow existing test patterns (framework and naming conventions noted above)
- NEVER create a standalone "e2e-consolidation", "playwright-e2e", or "e2e-tests" change that only writes E2E tests. This anti-pattern overloads one agent with all cross-feature tests and wastes tokens. Each feature change MUST include its OWN E2E tests inline.

Sub-domain dependency chaining:
- When splitting a large feature domain into multiple changes, those changes MUST form a depends_on chain (sequential execution within the domain)
- Different domain chains can still run in parallel with each other
- Example: splitting "product-catalog" (22 reqs) into product-list → product-detail → product-search — each depends_on the previous, but all can run in parallel with an unrelated "user-auth" chain

Split heuristics for common patterns:
- List page + detail page → split into separate changes if combined requirements exceed 6
- CRUD operations → separate from read-only views when the domain is large
- Search/filtering with its own API routes → separate change
- Auth + profile + password management → split auth/login from profile/account management

Dependency ordering heuristics — classify each change by type and apply ordering:
- Classify each change as one of: infrastructure (test/build setup, CI), schema (DB migrations, model changes), foundational (auth, shared types, base components), feature (new functionality), cleanup-before (refactor/rename/reorganize existing code), cleanup-after (dead code removal, cosmetic fixes)
- infrastructure changes run first — all others depend on them
- schema/migration changes run before data-layer or API changes that use those tables
- foundational changes (auth, shared types) run before features that consume them
- cleanup-before/refactor changes run before feature changes that touch the same area (e.g., a UI cleanup should complete before new UI features are built on that code)
- cleanup-after changes run last — they depend on the features they clean up around
- If the spec contains explicit dependency hints (e.g., "depends_on: X", "requires X", "after X is complete"), preserve them in the output depends_on array

Shared resource awareness:
- If 2+ parallel changes would likely modify the same shared file (conventions docs, shared types, config files, common UI components), chain them via depends_on to prevent merge conflicts
- Prefer serialization over parallel execution when shared files are involved
- Common shared resources: design/convention docs, shared type definitions, package.json, layout components

Test-per-change requirement:
- Each change that adds a user-facing route, feature, or API endpoint MUST include its own tests. Do NOT defer all testing to a final "e2e" change.
- The quality gate BLOCKS changes without test files for feature/infrastructure types.
- Explicitly list test files in scope (e.g., "Tests: Create orders.test.ts").

Phase assignment — group changes into execution phases for milestone checkpoints:
- Assign a phase integer (1..N, max 5) to each change
- Phase 1: infrastructure, schema, foundational changes
- Phases 2..N-1: features grouped by domain coherence (related features in same phase)
- Last phase: cleanup-after, polish
- For specs with fewer than 4 changes, assign all to phase 1
- Changes within a phase can run in parallel; phases execute sequentially
- Dependencies across phases are respected regardless of phase assignment

Model selection — suggest a model per change based on task nature:
- "opus" for ALL changes that write functional code (features, bug fixes, refactors, cleanup, tests)
- "sonnet" ONLY for doc-only changes (doc sync, doc audit, README updates) — zero code writing
- Sonnet cannot follow OpenSpec workflows, make architecture decisions, or write quality code
- When in doubt, always use "opus"

Quality gate profiles — each change_type has a different set of active verification gates:
- infrastructure: scope_check + review + rules only. Build/test/e2e/smoke are SKIPPED (no app code yet). spec_verify is soft (non-blocking).
- schema: build + scope_check + review + spec_verify + rules. Test is warn-only (may lack test files). e2e and smoke SKIPPED. test_files NOT required.
- foundational: build + test + scope_check + review + spec_verify + rules. e2e and smoke SKIPPED by default (project-type plugins may override, e.g., web projects enable e2e for auth cold-visit tests).
- feature: ALL gates active (build, test, e2e, scope_check, review, spec_verify, rules, smoke). test_files required.
- cleanup-before: build + scope_check + review + rules. Test is warn-only. e2e and smoke SKIPPED. spec_verify is soft. test_files NOT required.
- cleanup-after: build + scope_check only. Test is warn-only, review/rules/e2e/smoke SKIPPED. spec_verify is soft. Lightest profile.
The planner can emit optional "gate_hints" per change to override specific gates (e.g., {"e2e": "skip"} for a feature that has no UI).

Manual tasks — flag changes that require human intervention:
- Set "has_manual_tasks": true when a change involves: external API keys/secrets (Stripe, AWS, Firebase), third-party account/project creation, OAuth app registration, DNS configuration, webhook setup, or any step that cannot be automated
- Examples: "integrate Stripe payments" (needs API key), "set up Firebase auth" (needs project creation), "configure custom domain" (needs DNS records)
- When false or omitted, all tasks are assumed automatable

CRITICAL — Output size constraint:
- Your ENTIRE JSON response MUST fit in a SINGLE message. You will NOT get a second turn.
- MAX 15 changes. If the spec requires more, merge related changes aggressively.
- Keep scope text concise (800-1500 chars). Do NOT pad with implementation details.
- Keep reasoning to 2-3 sentences. Keep phase_detected to 1 sentence.
- Do NOT split your response across messages."""
