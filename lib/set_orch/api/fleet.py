⚠ Route ordering matters and is not cosmetic (finding CB-16). The dashboard
already serves a large `/api/{project}/...` family, and FastAPI resolves routes
in registration order, so a wildcard registered first would swallow
`/api/fleet/...` and answer it as a project named "fleet". This router is
therefore included **before** the project routers in `api/__init__.py`, and the
unit test `test_fleet_api.py` fails if that ordering is lost.

Nothing derived from a session's *content* is returned or logged — only its
identity, its project, and a state derived from structure (which tool is
outstanding, how long the log has been quiet). The confidentiality boundary in
CLAUDE.md is a persistence boundary, and this endpoint persists nothing at all.

      15 commands, 39 s of subprocess work per 30 s cache window, axis `None`

    anywhere on the machine, and nothing on the screen ever offers that.

    ## Built from the SAME union the list is, and that is the whole point

    This used to enumerate its own two sources — the registry, and the roots of
    discovered agents — which was a second definition of *what this screen
    knows*. It was correct while the list had those same two sources, and it
    went wrong silently the moment a third arrived.

    Measured 2026-08-19, on a report that a project visible on screen refused to
    start an agent: **49 projects served, 39 roots known here, 10 refused** — 9
    of them supplied only by the messaging registry, and 1 by a live process
    whose root this enumeration missed. The screen offered a start control on
    every one of them.

    This is the defect the union's own filter already had, thirty lines below,

    that one and leaving this one is the same class again — **completing a set
    means auditing everything downstream of it**, because any later step that
    re-states the set is a copy that drifted the moment the set changed. So the
    guard now asks the list rather than rebuilding it, and a fourth source

    ⚠ Archived projects are IN, and that is measured rather than reasoned.
    `discover_projects`'s own docstring says an archived project *"is excluded by

    code below it carries the flag without ever filtering on it. Measured
    2026-08-19 on the live server: **19 of the 49 projects served are archived**,
    and the screen shows every one. Believing that sentence and filtering here
    would have re-created the very divergence this function was just repaired
    for, in the other direction: a project on screen, with a start control, that

# the ownership checks, and a `dry_run` that is honest about its blast radius.
# This route's only jobs are to refuse a target the screen never showed, and to
# hand the installer's report back UNCHANGED.
