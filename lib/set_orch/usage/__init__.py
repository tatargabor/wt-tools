"""Account usage measurement — headless, and deliberately free of any GUI import.

The rolling 5-hour and 7-day quota was measured on this machine long before this
package existed, but only inside a `QThread` in the desktop Control Center, which
means only where PySide6 loads. The fleet screen — where somebody decides whether
to start another agent — had no way to reach it.

What lives here is the measurement and nothing else: who the accounts are
(`accounts`), what the upstream says about them (`client`), and a poller that
keeps one answer fresh so a reader never triggers a network call (`poller`).
Rendering belongs to whoever is reading — the desktop strip, the fleet header,
a CLI.

Two rules run through all three modules and are worth stating once:

- **A missing figure is never a zero.** An account can answer `200` and carry no
  window at all; measured 2026-08-27, one of three configured accounts did
  exactly that. Reported as `0` it reads as "nothing consumed", which is the
  opposite of what is known.
- **The credential does not travel.** `Account` holds it because the client needs
  it; `AccountUsage` — the thing every caller gets — has no field that could
  carry it.
