"""Reading an account's rolling usage windows from the upstream account API.

## What the upstream actually answers

Measured 2026-08-27 against three configured accounts (all `200`, 0.64–0.71 s
each), the usage document carries the same figures twice:

- `five_hour` / `seven_day` — `{utilization, resets_at, limit_dollars: null, …}`,
  and **either may be `null` on an account that answered perfectly well**
- `limits` — the same figures already banded by the service:
  `{kind, group, percent, severity, resets_at, scope, is_active}`, including
  `weekly_scoped` entries that name one model

`limits` is preferred because it carries the **severity**, and a threshold chosen
here would be a second opinion about somebody else's limit — one that drifts
silently the day theirs moves. Measured the same day: a 96 % weekly window
arrived already labelled `critical` without anyone here picking 96.

## Three outcomes, and why they are three

`unreachable` (no transport got an answer), `unmeasured` (an answer with no
figures in it), and `measured` are distinct states, not shades of failure. The
middle one is the reason: an account that answers with both windows `null` is
reachable, healthy, and unknown. Folded into either neighbour it tells the reader
something false — that the account is broken, or that it has consumed nothing.
