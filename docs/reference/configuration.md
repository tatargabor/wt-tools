context_pruning: true
model_routing: off          # off | complexity
plan_approval: false
plan_method: api            # api | agent
```

### Directive Reference

| Directive | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_parallel` | int | `2` | Max concurrent changes |
| `default_model` | string | `opus` | Default LLM model |
| `time_limit` | duration | `5h` | Stop after duration (`2h`, `4h30m`, `none`) |
| `checkpoint_interval` | int | `5` | Merge-checkpoint every N changes |
| `test_command` | string | `""` | Test command before merge |
| `build_command` | string | `""` | Build command before merge |
| `smoke_command` | string | `""` | Post-merge smoke test |
| `smoke_timeout` | int | `120` | Smoke test timeout (seconds) |
| `smoke_blocking` | bool | `true` | Smoke failure blocks pipeline |
| `review_model` | string | `""` | Model for code review gate |
| `model_routing` | string | `off` | `off` or `complexity` |
| `plan_approval` | bool | `false` | Require approval after plan |
| `plan_method` | string | `api` | `api` (single LLM call) or `agent` (planning worktree) |
| `context_pruning` | bool | `true` | Remove orchestrator commands from agent worktrees |
| `max_tokens_per_change` | int | `0` | Per-change token budget (0 = complexity defaults) |
| `watchdog_timeout` | int | `""` | Seconds before watchdog considers change stuck |
| `watchdog_loop_threshold` | int | `""` | Identical hashes before loop detection |

| `events_max_size` | int | `1048576` | Events log rotation threshold (bytes) |
| `post_merge_command` | string | `""` | Command after merge (e.g., `pnpm db:generate`) |

### Planner directives

Nested under `planner:` in `orchestration.yaml`.

| Directive | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `planner.force_strategy` | string | `auto` | `flat` \| `domain-parallel` \| `auto`. When set to `flat` or `domain-parallel`, the digest-mode planner skips the threshold check and takes the named branch unconditionally. `auto` preserves the requirement-count threshold (≥30 → domain-parallel, otherwise flat). |

```yaml
planner:
  force_strategy: flat   # or domain-parallel, or auto (default)
```

When the knob is set to a non-`auto` value, the planner emits an INFO log naming `source=force_strategy` so forensic review distinguishes operator-forced strategy from threshold-driven choice.

### Retry & Circuit Breaker Limits

All retry/circuit-breaker limits live in `config.py DIRECTIVE_DEFAULTS` as the single source of truth (`verify-gate-resilience-fixes`). Defaults reflect evidence from production runs.

| Directive | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_verify_retries` | `12` | Verify-gate retry ceiling (was 8 — raised after `order-cancellation-and-returns` retried 9× before convergence) |
| `max_merge_retries` | `5` | Merge-queue retry ceiling (was hardcoded 3 in `merger.py`; cross-cutting changes need >3 rebases) |
| `max_integration_retries` | `5` | Integration-merge-conflict retry ceiling (was hardcoded 3 in `verifier.py`) |
| `e2e_retry_limit` | `8` | Integration-e2e redispatch ceiling (was 5 — sibling-test pollution convergence) |
| `max_stuck_loops` | `5` | Consecutive `loop_status=stuck` exits before fix-iss escalation (was 3 — false-positive on planner-blamed work) |
| `max_replan_retries` | `5` | Replan ceiling before terminal failure (was 3) |
| `watchdog_timeout_running` | `1800` | Seconds idle in `running` state before watchdog escalates (was 600 — agent gondolkodás >10m frequent) |
| `watchdog_timeout_verifying` | `1200` | Seconds idle in `verifying` state (was 300 — 24-spec Playwright suite needs ~15-20 min) |
| `watchdog_timeout_dispatched` | `120` | Seconds idle in `dispatched` state before re-dispatch (unchanged) |
| `issue_diagnosed_timeout_secs` | `5400` | Seconds an issue may stay in `diagnosed` before timeout watchdog fires (was 3600 — fix-iss dispatch chain takes ~65 min for cross-cutting bugs) |
| `per_change_token_runaway_threshold` | `50000000` | Token-delta budget per change before runaway breaker fires (50 M); a WARNING + memory entry fires at 80% as pre-warning |
| `max_retry_wall_time_ms` | `5400000` | Aggregate retry wall-time budget per change (90 min) |
| `max_consecutive_cache_uses` | `2` | Consecutive gate-cache reuses before forced full run |

#### Deprecated

- **`token_hard_limit`** (was 20 M) — DEPRECATED in `verify-gate-resilience-fixes`. Redundant with `per_change_token_runaway_threshold`. Still parsed for backward compat (no crash on existing configs); a deprecation WARNING is logged at startup if set, and the value is reset to `0` so the legacy runtime check is skipped. Migrate to `per_change_token_runaway_threshold`.

#### Behaviour notes

- The `max_*` retry directives override module-level constants in `merger.py`, `verifier.py`, `watchdog.py`, and `issues/models.py`. Default values come from `DIRECTIVE_DEFAULTS` in `lib/set_orch/config.py`.
- A pytest parity test (`tests/unit/test_config_engine_parity.py`) prevents silent divergence between `config.py` and the `Directives` dataclass — raising one constant alone is no longer possible.

### Hooks

| Directive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `hook_pre_dispatch` | Before dispatching a change (non-zero blocks) |
| `hook_post_verify` | After verification passes (non-zero blocks merge) |
| `hook_pre_merge` | Before merge (non-zero blocks) |
| `hook_post_merge` | After successful merge (non-blocking) |
| `hook_on_fail` | When change transitions to `failed` |

Hook scripts receive `(change_name, status, worktree_path)` as arguments.

### Setting Precedence

1. **CLI flags** (`--max-parallel`, `--time-limit`) — highest priority
2. **Config file** (`.claude/orchestration.yaml`)
3. **In-document directives** (`## Orchestrator Directives` in spec)
4. **Defaults** — lowest priority

## project-type.yaml

Identifies the project type so the correct profile loads. Created by `set-project init`.

```yaml
project_type: web
template: nextjs
```

Without this file, `NullProfile` loads and integration gates silently skip (no build/test/e2e detection).

## gui-config.json

GUI appearance settings at `~/.config/set-core/gui-config.json`:

```json
{
  "control_center": {
    "opacity_default": 0.5,
    "opacity_hover": 1.0,
    "window_width": 500,
    "refresh_interval_ms": 2000,
    "blink_interval_ms": 500,
    "color_profile": "light"
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `opacity_default` | `0.5` | Window opacity when not hovered |
| `opacity_hover` | `1.0` | Window opacity on hover |
| `window_width` | `500` | Window width in pixels |
| `refresh_interval_ms` | `2000` | Status refresh interval |
| `blink_interval_ms` | `500` | Blink interval for waiting agents |
| `color_profile` | `"light"` | Color theme: `light`, `dark`, `high_contrast` |

## Editor Configuration

```bash
set-config editor list           # list supported editors
set-config editor set <name>     # set preferred editor
```

Supported editors: `zed` (primary), `vscode`, `cursor`, `windsurf`.

## Provider Configuration (providers.json)

One machine-level file holds every provider credential: **`~/.config/set-core/providers.json`**,
mode `0600` (honouring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). The framework **refuses to read it** when the mode
says group-readable — it holds credentials. Every set project inherits it by *reading* it;
nothing copies it into a project tree, and the deploy path never writes one.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "default": { "provider": "glm", "model": "glm-5.3-flash" },
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "models": ["haiku", "sonnet", "opus", "sonnet-1m", "opus-1m",
                 "opus-4-6", "opus-4-7", "opus-4-6-1m", "opus-4-7-1m", "fable"],
      "requires_credential": false,
      "credential": null,
      "default_model": "opus",
      "env": {},
      "args": [],

        "opus-4-7": "claude-opus-4-7",
        "opus-4-6-1m": "claude-opus-4-6[1m]",
        "opus-4-7-1m": "claude-opus-4-7[1m]"
      }
    },
    "glm": {
      "models": ["glm-5.3-flash"],
      "requires_credential": true,
      "default_model": "glm-5.3-flash",
      "credential": { "token": "…", "base_url": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic" },
      "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS": "900000" },
      "args": ["--autocompact", "700k"],
      "model_aliases": { "sonnet": "glm-5.3" }
    },
    "astra": {
      "models": ["gpt-6-astra", "gpt-5.6-luna"],
      "requires_credential": true,
      "default_model": "gpt-6-astra",
      "credential": { "token": "local", "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:17645/anthropic" },
      "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS": "272000" },
      "args": ["--autocompact", "200k"],
      "model_aliases": { "opus": "gpt-6-astra", "sonnet": "gpt-6-astra",
                         "fable": "gpt-6-astra", "haiku": "gpt-5.6-luna" },
      "model_ids": { "gpt-6-astra": "anthropic-openai-oauth__gpt-6-astra",
                     "gpt-5.6-luna": "anthropic-openai-oauth__gpt-5.6-luna" }
    }
  },
  "projects": {
    "some-project": { "provider": "glm", "model": "glm-5.3" }
  }
}
```

The `model_ids` block maps a catalogue's short names to the ids the agent CLI
consumes. It is OPTIONAL: a declared `anthropic` without one gets the framework's
shipped default (exactly the mapping above), and any other provider without one
gets no translation — a real-id catalogue needs none. A declared block replaces
the default WHOLE, never merged with it, so re-pinning a name is a data edit;
`fable` is deliberately unmapped (the CLI resolves it natively). `set-providers
show` displays the effective mapping alongside the resolved launch.

The rules the resolver enforces (spec: `agent-provider-config`):

- **Precedence has three levels** — machine default → per-project override → the request
  itself. The model may come from a different level than the provider; the **credential and
  its `base_url` are one block** and never split across levels (a key is issued for one
  endpoint — splitting them yields a 401 or the wrong bill).
- **`requires_credential` is declared, never inferred.** `true` with `credential: null` is a
  legitimate "declared but not configured" state: the launch refuses loudly instead of
  reaching an unauthenticated endpoint.
- **An absent or unreadable configuration fails loudly.** There is no fallback to another
  provider — a silent fallback would run the task anyway, and nothing would say which
  framework executed it.
- **The model catalogue is data, not code** — adding a model or provider means editing this
  file, nothing else.

```bash
set-providers path        # where the file is expected
set-providers show        # content, token masked — never prints a credential
set-providers list        # the catalogue a surface is offered
set-providers migrate     # carry an older ~/.config/set-core/glm.env over, one command
```

An in-repo `.env` with `GLM_*` lines is **discontinued** as a credential source — a run
names that explicitly instead of reporting "token not found". Only the `GLM_`-prefixed lines
are ever read from a legacy file, so a `source .env` cannot drag `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` along.

For GLM specifically, the measured endpoint, model names, context-window env and the three
failure modes (gateway-prefixed model names, autocompact needing
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`, compact thrashing that looks like a slow model) are in
`.claude/skills/set/glm/SKILL.md`; `set-glm --check` verifies the configuration with a live
probe call.

### Two kinds of provider: direct, and gateway-backed

`anthropic` and `glm` are **direct**: their `base_url` names a vendor host that already speaks
the Anthropic protocol, and the credential is the upstream token.

`astra` in the example above is **gateway-backed**, and the difference is worth stating because
the shape of the entry looks alarming otherwise. Some vendors do not speak the Anthropic
protocol at all, so the harness reaches them through a **local translating gateway**, and the
provider entry then points at loopback:

- **`base_url` is `127.0.0.1`, not a vendor host.** The gateway is the endpoint.
- **`token` is a local placeholder, not a secret.** The gateway holds the real credential (an
  OAuth login of its own) and accepts any non-empty key from the loopback side. **Never put the
  upstream OAuth token in `providers.json`** — it would be a credential stored where it buys
  nothing and can leak.
- **`model_ids` carries the gateway's own ids.** A gateway rewrites model names (commonly
  `<something>__<model>`), and the catalogue name is what a human reads while the id is what
  the CLI sends. This is exactly the block that mapping exists for.
- **`env` and `args` still describe the MODEL, not the gateway** — the context window and the
  autocompact point belong to whatever answers on the far side.

### Wiring a gateway-backed provider

The gateway is a separate tool, installed and signed in once per machine; set-core neither
ships nor installs it, and never sees its credential.

```bash
# 1. install the gateway and sign in (its own OAuth flow, a browser or device code)
# 2. run it as a user service so it survives a reboot, then:
set-providers path                    # where the entry belongs
$EDITOR "$(set-providers path)"       # add the block, keep the file at mode 0600
set-providers list                    # the entry appears; `usable` says whether it can start
set-providers show --provider astra   # the resolved launch, credential never printed
```

`set-providers list` reporting `"usable": false, "reason": "no credential configured"` is a
**correct** answer for a declared-but-unfinished provider, not a failure — see
`requires_credential` above.

⚠ **One measured trap when the gateway runs under systemd.** A user unit is handed a minimal
`PATH`, so a `#!/usr/bin/env node`-style launcher can resolve to an interpreter old enough to
fail while parsing the gateway itself — the service then restart-loops on a `SyntaxError` and
nothing on the dashboard says the provider is unreachable, because a provider that never
answers looks like one nobody started. Name the interpreter by absolute path in `ExecStart`,
and set an explicit `Environment=PATH=…`.

**Launching.** Any declared provider can be chosen when starting an agent from the fleet
surface — the owner service resolves it through the same resolver as everything else. `set-glm`
is a GLM-specific convenience wrapper and has no per-provider counterpart; for anything else
the fleet's provider selection (or a project override) is the shipped path.

**Quota.** A provider whose plan exposes a usage endpoint also appears in the fleet header's
account strip beside the Claude accounts and GLM, with its own rolling windows. That
measurement is discovered independently of `providers.json` — it reads the gateway tool's own
login — so an account can show there while the provider entry is still unfinished, and vice
versa. Neither implies the other.

## Environment Variables

Common `.env` variables used by set-core and consumer projects:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude API key for orchestration |
| `E2E_PROJECT` | Project name for E2E tests |
| `SET_CORE_DEBUG` | Enable debug logging |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | Override default model |

## CLAUDE.md

Project-level instructions read by Claude Code on every session. Typical sections:

- **Memory** — what the native per-repository memory layer is, and what it does not do
- **Help and Documentation** — where to find skill/CLI docs
- **Getting Started** — install, dev, test commands
- **E2E Run Setup** — how to scaffold and start E2E runs

This file is maintained manually. `set-project init` does not overwrite it.
