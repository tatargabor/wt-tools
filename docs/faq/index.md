# Frequently Asked Questions

A comprehensive FAQ for architects, CTOs, and senior engineers evaluating SET (ShipExactlyThis) — the autonomous multi-agent orchestration framework for Claude Code.

---

## General

### What is SET?

SET is an orchestration framework that transforms a product specification into fully implemented, tested, and merged code — autonomously. You write a detailed markdown spec (data model, pages, design tokens, auth flows, seed data); SET decomposes it into independent changes, dispatches parallel Claude Code agents into isolated git worktrees, runs deterministic quality gates (build, test, E2E, code review), and merges the results. No babysitting required.

### Who is SET for?

Development teams and technical leaders who already use Claude Code and want to scale beyond single-agent, single-task workflows. If you're an architect managing a backlog of well-specified features, or a CTO evaluating how AI agents can own the full implementation-to-merge cycle, SET is the layer that makes that possible. It assumes you can write a good spec — it handles everything after that.

### Is this production-ready?

SET was built with itself over 79 days (1,500+ commits, 376 capability specifications, 350+ archived OpenSpec changes, 720+ hours of continuous autonomous agent runtime). It has completed 200+ full E2E orchestration runs with published benchmarks: the MiniShop benchmark delivers 6/6 changes merged, zero human intervention, in 1h 45m. CraftBrew (15 changes, 150+ files, 28 DB models) completed fully autonomously in ~6h. These are real projects with real tests passing.

## How Is SET Different From...

### ...just using Claude Code?

Claude Code in 2026 is dramatically capable on its own: native worktrees (`--worktree`), Agent Teams (experimental, 3-5 agents), 26 hook events with 4 handler types, auto-memory (`MEMORY.md`), Plan mode, subagents with worktree isolation, the Agent SDK, and MCP support. SET is built *on top of* all these primitives — it provides the opinionated orchestration workflow that ties them together.

| | Claude Code (alone) | SET |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | One task or one team session | Full spec → decomposed into N parallel changes |
| **Planning** | Plan mode (freeform, ephemeral, read-only) | OpenSpec: persistent versioned artifacts (proposal → spec → design → tasks) |
| **Quality** | Hooks *can* run checks, but you wire them yourself | Structured gate pipeline: dep install → build → test → E2E → review → smoke |
| **Merging** | Manual `git merge`, no enforcement | Automated merge queue with integration gates, conflict resolution, post-merge verification |
| **Recovery** | Session dies, you restart manually | Sentinel detects crashes in 30s, auto-restarts, graduated escalation |
| **Memory** | Auto-memory (flat file loaded at startup) | Semantic memory graph with topic-based recall, auto-injection at every lifecycle point |
| **State** | Session-scoped, lost on restart | Atomic JSON state file with full orchestration history, resumable across restarts |
| **Coordination** | Agent Teams: shared task list + mailbox (one session) | Cross-session, cross-machine orchestration with sentinel supervisor |

Claude Code gives you excellent building blocks. SET gives you the assembled machine: planning, dispatch, monitoring, gating, merging, replanning — the full outer loop. You *could* build this yourself using the Agent SDK and hooks — SET is the battle-tested implementation.

**What SET doesn't have that Claude Code does natively:** Claude Code's 101+ plugin marketplace, the Agent SDK for custom agent development, and deep IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains). SET is CLI-first with a web dashboard, not an IDE experience.

### ...Claude Code Agent Teams?

Agent Teams (experimental since v2.1.32) coordinate multiple Claude instances within a single session with a shared task list and inter-agent messaging. 3-5 teammates recommended. Important: teammates share the same working directory by default — two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Worktree isolation is available via subagent `isolation: worktree` but is not automatic.

- **Agent Teams** = parallelism *within* one session. A lead assigns subtasks; teammates share context and message each other. Good for breaking down a single feature. Still experimental: no session resumption for teammates, task status can lag, shutdown can be slow, one team per session, lead is fixed.
- **SET** = parallelism *across* sessions, machines, and time. A planner decomposes a full spec into a dependency DAG of independent changes, dispatches each to its own worktree with its own long-running agent, runs quality gates before merge, and manages the merge pipeline. Good for shipping an entire product.

They're complementary. SET can use Agent Teams inside each worktree for complex individual changes while managing the cross-change orchestration externally.

**What Agent Teams does better:** Zero-setup parallelism within a session. No framework installation, no orchestration config. Start a team with one environment variable. For a quick parallel task within a single feature, Agent Teams is faster to reach for.

### ...Cursor's parallel agents?

Cursor 3 (April 2026) has two parallelism modes:

- **Local worktree agents** (up to 8 via Agents Window) — uses `git worktree add` for filesystem isolation, runs on your machine.
- **Cloud Background Agents** (no hard cap, credit-bound) — each runs in an isolated Ubuntu VM on AWS. You can close your laptop. Each agent gets its own terminal, browser, and full desktop.

What Cursor has:
- **Cloud execution** — agents run in Cursor's cloud. No local resources needed.
- **Git branch + PR workflow** — each agent creates a branch and opens a PR with a video recording of its actions.
- **Cursor Rules** (`.cursor/rules/`) — `.mdc` files with glob-scoped instructions injected into context.
- **Auto-generated memories** — optional setting that creates `.mdc` memory files from chat interactions.
- **CI auto-fix cookbook** — GitHub Actions recipe that triggers a Cursor agent when CI fails.
- **Environment config** — `.cursor/environment.json` for setup commands, Dockerfiles, env variables.

What Cursor lacks vs SET:
- **No spec decomposition.** Agents launched from ad-hoc prompts or issues, not from a structured spec with dependency ordering.
- **No pre-merge quality gates.** Cursor's own published stat: **~30% of generated PRs pass CI and merge** without intervention. The other 70% need human help. SET's MiniShop: 100% merge, zero intervention.
- **No inter-agent coordination.** Multiple agents have no awareness of each other. No merge conflict prevention, no merge ordering.
- **No persistent orchestration state.** No tracking across restarts, no resumable state.
- **No sentinel supervision.** No crash recovery or stall detection.

**What Cursor does better:** Cloud execution (no local cost, works while you sleep), local worktree agents with zero framework setup, polished IDE experience, multi-model support. For small, independent tasks, Cursor is easier to reach for.

**Cost caveat:** Cloud agents are credit-based, typically $5-15 per merged PR. Pricing is opaque — users have reported spending $2,000+ in two days with heavy usage. SET's local execution has no per-run cost beyond the Claude API.

### ...Devin?

Devin (by Cognition) is an autonomous AI software engineer — takes a task and works end-to-end in a sandboxed VM: planning, coding, testing, PR creation. Can run multiple concurrent sessions, each in its own VM.

| | Devin | SET |
|---|---|---|
| **Execution** | Cloud VM sandbox | Local worktrees |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple independent sessions (no coordination) | Coordinated parallel via orchestrator + merge queue |
| **Planning** | Informal step-by-step (visible in UI) | OpenSpec: structured artifacts with traceability |
| **Testing** | Runs tests if they exist (ad-hoc) | Structured gate pipeline (build → test → E2E → review) |
| **Self-review** | Basic re-read (inconsistent) | Separate verification phase with code review gate |
| **Integrations** | Excellent Slack/Jira/GitHub (trigger via Slack message) | CLI + web dashboard + MCP |
| **Merge safety** | Opens PR, relies on CI | Integration gates enforced before merge |
| **Recovery** | Within-session retry | Sentinel: crash detection, stall recovery, redispatch |

**What Devin does better:** Slack integration is best-in-class — assign a task from Slack, get a PR back. The sandboxed VM means zero local setup. The UI for watching agent work is polished. For well-scoped, independent tasks (migrations, CRUD endpoints, test writing), Devin's workflow is smoother than setting up SET orchestration.

**What SET does better:** Multi-change coordination, spec-driven traceability, quality gates before merge (not after), sentinel supervision, persistent memory, and deterministic merge ordering. SET is for shipping a product from spec; Devin is for delegating individual tasks.

### ...Kiro (Amazon)?

Kiro (GA since November 2025) is the closest philosophical match: a spec-driven agentic IDE with formal requirements (EARS notation), design documents, and task lists. Built on VS Code, powered by Amazon Bedrock. Supports Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, and other models via an auto-router.

Kiro's genuine innovations:
- **Spec flow with EARS notation.** Requirements → Design Doc → Tasks, with two entry points (Requirements-First or Design-First). Uses formal EARS syntax with SHALL statements. Specs stay synced with code.
- **Property-Based Testing (PBT).** Extracts testable properties from requirements, generates hundreds of random test inputs, uses shrinking to find minimal failing cases. Auto-fixes implementation. This is a genuine quality mechanism SET doesn't have.
- **10 hook trigger types.** File Create/Save/Delete, Prompt Submit, Agent Stop, Pre/Post Tool Use, Pre/Post Task Execution, Manual. Both agent-prompt and shell-command actions.
- **Autonomous Agent (preview).** Background agent with 3 sub-agents (planner, writer, verifier). Up to 10 concurrent tasks across multiple repos. Opens PRs, never auto-merges. Learns from code review feedback.
- **Steering files** with 4 inclusion modes: Always, Conditional (glob-scoped), Manual (referenced via `#name`), Auto (description-matched).
- **Multi-model** — Claude (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, GLM, plus auto-router.
- **Pricing:** Free (50 credits) → Pro ($20/mo, 1000) → Pro+ ($40, 2000) → Power ($200, 10000).

| | Kiro | SET |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec system** | In-IDE wizard, EARS notation, synced with code | CLI-driven OpenSpec, delta specs, archived changes |
| **Agent scope** | IDE + Autonomous Agent (preview, 10 concurrent tasks) | Daemon-based, hours-long runs, N parallel agents |
| **Quality** | PBT + LSP diagnostics (35ms) + 10 hook types | Gate pipeline: build → test → E2E → review → smoke |
| **Merge handling** | Opens PRs (never auto-merges) | Integration-gated merge queue with conflict resolution |
| **Memory** | Steering files (4 modes) | Semantic memory with cross-session learning |
| **Models** | Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen, auto-router | Claude Code harness; model switchable (GLM and a ChatGPT/Codex plan shipped) |
| **Design integration** | None | Design pipeline (tokens, briefs, per-change design.md) |

**What Kiro does better:** Property-Based Testing is genuinely novel — random test generation from spec properties that SET doesn't have. The Autonomous Agent handles 10 concurrent tasks across repos. Multi-model support with auto-routing. Lower barrier to entry. 10 hook trigger types (vs SET's orchestration-level hooks). For a single developer or small team wanting structured AI with quality feedback, Kiro is more accessible.

**What SET does better:** Spec decomposition into dependency DAGs, coordinated parallel execution with merge ordering, deterministic integration gates before merge (not just PBT), sentinel supervision with crash recovery, cross-session semantic memory, and design system integration. SET manages the full lifecycle; Kiro's Autonomous Agent opens PRs but never merges.

### ...Roo Code (Roo Cline)?

Roo Code organizes AI capabilities into configurable modes (Architect, Code, Debug, Ask, custom) with a "Boomerang" pattern where an Orchestrator mode delegates subtasks to specialized modes. Model-agnostic.

The "multi-agent" is really multi-*mode* within a single session — sequential delegation, not parallel execution:
- No worktree isolation (all modes operate on the same workspace).
- No merge pipeline or quality gates.
- No structured spec system.
- No persistent orchestration state or cross-session memory (manual rules files only).

**What Roo Code does better:** Extremely easy to set up. Custom modes are intuitive — define a persona with tools and permissions, no code needed. Model-agnostic — use any LLM provider. Fully open source with an active community. For individual developers who want flexible AI assistance without framework overhead, Roo Code is lighter and more accessible.

### ...Aider?

Aider is a CLI-based AI pair programmer — interactive, lightweight, model-agnostic. Single-agent, single-session. No parallelism, no spec decomposition, no quality gates, no merge orchestration.

**What Aider does genuinely better than SET (and most alternatives):**
- **Git integration** — best-in-class. Every edit auto-committed with meaningful messages. Full undo via `git revert`. No other tool matches this.
- **Model flexibility** — supports virtually every LLM provider. Easy mid-session model switching. SET's harness is Claude Code only; its model is switchable via `providers.json` (GLM and a ChatGPT/Codex plan shipped, both measured).
- **Repo map** — tree-sitter-based symbol map gives the LLM structural codebase awareness efficiently. Smart context management.
- **Cost efficiency** — careful token usage, transparent cost tracking per message.
- **Edit format innovation** — matches diff format to model capability (diff, whole-file, udiff). Genuine innovation.

Aider is a tool you'd use *inside* a worktree; SET is the system that manages the worktrees. Complementary, not competitive.

### ...Cline?

Cline is a VS Code extension where every action is transparent and controllable. Has an auto-approve mode but fundamentally designed for human oversight.

**What Cline does better:**
- **MCP marketplace** — best-in-class. MCP server discovery, installation, and configuration directly in the extension. The largest MCP ecosystem.
- **Transparency** — shows every tool call, diff, and command. You see exactly what the agent does and why.
- **Model flexibility** — any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, custom endpoints).
- **Open source** — fully open, active community, rapid iteration.

Different philosophy: Cline is deliberate, transparent, human-in-the-loop. SET is autonomous, hands-off, spec-driven. For developers who want to understand and approve every change, Cline is the right tool.

### ...GitHub Copilot Coding Agent?

Copilot Coding Agent is GitHub's background AI — assign a GitHub Issue to Copilot, it creates a branch, makes changes, runs your CI (GitHub Actions), self-reviews, and opens a PR. Runs in GitHub-hosted cloud environments.

| | Copilot Coding Agent | SET |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub Issue assignment | Spec document |
| **Execution** | Cloud (GitHub-hosted) | Local worktrees |
| **Quality** | Runs existing CI + self-review | Structured gate pipeline before merge |
| **Parallelism** | Multiple independent agents (no coordination) | Coordinated parallel with dependency DAG |
| **Merge** | Opens PR, human reviews | Automated merge queue with integration gates |
| **Distribution** | GitHub-native (largest distribution) | Framework installation needed |

**What Copilot does better:** Zero setup for GitHub users — it's built in. GitHub-native workflow (Issue → PR). Cloud execution. The largest distribution of any AI coding agent. For well-scoped, independent issues, it's the lowest-friction option.

**What SET does better:** Coordinated multi-change development from a single spec. Copilot handles one issue → one PR with no awareness of other agents on the same repo. SET manages the dependencies, merge ordering, conflict resolution, and spec coverage tracking.

### ...Augment Intent?

Augment Intent (public beta, February 2026, macOS only) is architecturally the most similar tool to SET. It features:

- **Living Specifications** — self-maintaining spec documents that auto-update as agents work. When requirements change, updates propagate to active agents. Similar to OpenSpec's delta specs.
- **Coordinator/Specialist/Verifier architecture** — a coordinator breaks specs into tasks, delegates to specialist agents (Investigate, Implement, Verify, Critique, Debug, Code Review), a verifier checks results.
- **Git worktree isolation** — each task creates a "Space" with its own branch and worktree. Very similar to SET's model.
- **Multi-agent with mixed models** — runs Augment's agents plus Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode. Can mix models per task (e.g., Opus for architecture, Sonnet for iteration).
- **No fixed agent cap** — "Run as many agents as the task needs. Intent keeps them in sync."
- **Proprietary Context Engine** — curates relevant context from thousands of sources.

| | Augment Intent | SET |
|---|---|---|
| **Specs** | Living specs (auto-updating) | OpenSpec with delta specs + archive |
| **Agents** | Coordinator + specialists + verifier | Planner + Ralph Loop + sentinel |
| **Isolation** | Worktree "Spaces" | Git worktrees |
| **Models** | Multi-model (Claude, Codex, etc.) | Claude Code harness; model switchable (GLM and a ChatGPT/Codex plan shipped) |
| **Quality** | Verifier agent | 7 deterministic gates (exit codes) |
| **Merge** | Not documented | Integration-gated merge queue |
| **Platform** | macOS only (desktop app) | Linux/macOS (CLI + web) |
| **Status** | Public beta | Production (200+ E2E runs) |

**What Augment does better:** Multi-model support (mix Opus for planning, Sonnet for coding), living specs that auto-update (SET's specs are explicit), specialist agent personas, and a polished desktop experience. The coordinator/specialist pattern is elegant.

**What SET does better:** Deterministic quality gates (exit codes, not agent judgment), proven production track record (200+ autonomous runs with published benchmarks), Linux support, web dashboard for monitoring, design system integration, persistent semantic memory, and the full merge pipeline with conflict resolution and post-merge verification. Augment Intent is in public beta on macOS only; SET has been battle-tested in production.

### ...Windsurf?

Windsurf (by Codeium) was an AI IDE with the Cascade engine for multi-step agentic actions with strong context tracking across files and terminal commands. OpenAI announced acquisition of Codeium for ~$3B (late 2024). Current product status post-acquisition is uncertain.

Single-agent IDE experience — no parallel execution, no spec decomposition, no quality gates, no merge pipeline. Cascade's context tracking within a session was genuinely strong, and autocomplete was fast.

### ...OpenHands (OpenDevin)?

OpenHands is the strongest open-source single-agent coding runtime — Docker-sandboxed, multi-model, strong SWE-bench results (50%+). It provides the *runtime* (execute code, browse web, edit files in a sandbox) but not the *orchestration* (spec decomposition, parallel coordination, quality gates, merge pipeline, sentinel).

You could theoretically build a SET-like orchestrator on top of OpenHands as the agent runtime. OpenHands alone is a worker, not a coordinator.

### ...Composio?

**Correction from earlier versions of this FAQ:** Composio is primarily a **tool-integration platform** (250+ pre-built API integrations for AI agents), not an agent orchestrator. It provides middleware for frameworks like CrewAI, LangGraph, and AutoGen to call external tools (GitHub, Jira, Slack, databases) via function calling. It has a reference SWE-agent implementation but no parallel orchestration, quality gates, or merge pipelines. Different category from SET.

### ...GPT-Engineer / Lovable?

Different category entirely. Lovable is an app builder for non-developers — prompt to MVP. SET is infrastructure for professional development teams who write detailed specs and expect production-quality, tested output. Lovable generates apps; SET generates software engineering process outcomes.

### Capability matrix: SET vs. the landscape

| Tool | Parallel Agents | Worktree Isolation | Structured Specs | Quality Gates | Merge Pipeline | Supervisor | Cloud Exec | Multi-Model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SET** | Yes | Yes | Yes (OpenSpec) | Yes (9 gates) | Yes | Yes (Sentinel) | No (local) | Claude Code (model switchable) |
| Augment Intent | Yes (coordinator) | Yes (Spaces) | Yes (living specs) | Verifier agent | Not documented | No | No | Yes (multi) |
| Claude Code | Experimental (Teams) | Yes (subagents) | No | Hooks (DIY) | No | No | No | Claude only |
| Cursor | Yes (local 8 + cloud) | Yes (worktrees + VMs) | No | No (~30% PR merge) | No | No | Yes | Multi-model |
| Devin | Independent sessions | Sandbox VMs | No | Ad-hoc tests | No | No | Yes | Proprietary |
| Kiro | Autonomous (10 tasks) | No | Yes (EARS + PBT) | PBT + hooks | No (opens PRs) | No | No | Yes (auto-router) |
| Copilot Agent | Independent agents | Cloud VMs | No | CI + self-review | No | No | Yes | GPT/Claude |
| Roo Code | No (modes) | No | No | No | No | No | No | Any LLM |
| Aider | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Any LLM |
| Cline | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Any LLM |
| OpenHands | Sub-agents (3) | Docker sandbox | No | No | No | No | Yes | Any LLM |

**What SET uniquely provides:** The combination of structured specs + parallel agents + deterministic gates + merge pipeline + sentinel + memory. Other tools excel where SET doesn't: cloud execution (Cursor, Devin, Copilot), model flexibility (Aider, Roo Code, Cline, Kiro), IDE integration (Kiro, Cursor), living specs (Augment Intent), Property-Based Testing (Kiro).

## OpenSpec

### What is OpenSpec and why not just use a prompt?

OpenSpec is a structured, artifact-driven methodology for specifying and implementing changes. Instead of a conversation or a prompt, work is expressed as a sequence of structured documents (artifacts) that serve as contracts between planner, implementer, and verifier:

1. **Proposal** — Why we're doing this (problem statement, impact)
2. **Specs** — What exactly must be built (requirements with WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria)
3. **Design** — How we'll build it (technical decisions, tradeoffs)
4. **Tasks** — Implementation checklist (each task tagged with `[REQ: requirement-name]` for traceability)

Why not just a prompt?

- **Prompts drift.** Agents interpret, improvise, skip requirements. OpenSpec specs are testable contracts with explicit IN SCOPE / OUT OF SCOPE boundaries.
- **Prompts can't be verified.** How do you check "build a webshop" was done correctly? OpenSpec verification checks every requirement against tasks against code.
- **Prompts don't compose.** When 5 agents work in parallel, a prompt gives no way to divide scope. OpenSpec's delta specs assign specific requirements to specific changes.
- **Prompts leave no record.** After merge, what was the design rationale? OpenSpec archives the full decision chain (proposal → spec → design → tasks) for future reference.

### How is this different from Claude Code's Plan mode?

Plan mode is a *thinking step* — Claude reads the codebase, analyzes the problem, and outlines an approach before implementing. It's freeform, ephemeral (exists within the session only), and advisory. Plans are not saved to disk as separate artifacts — when you accept a plan, Claude proceeds to implement. Ctrl+G opens the plan in your editor for manual editing.

OpenSpec is a *workflow system*:

| | Plan Mode | OpenSpec |
|---|---|---|
| **Output** | Freeform text plan | Structured artifacts (proposal, specs with WHEN/THEN, design, tasks) |
| **Persistence** | Session-scoped (lost when session ends) | Committed to repo, archived after completion |
| **Traceability** | None | Every task traces to a requirement: `[REQ: auth-login]` |
| **Verification** | None | Automated: completeness (all tasks done?), correctness (spec scenarios covered?), coherence (design followed?) |
| **Scope enforcement** | Trust | Explicit IN SCOPE / OUT OF SCOPE sections |
| **Multi-agent** | Not designed for it | Delta specs assign requirements to specific changes; agents get scoped work |

Plan mode helps a single agent think. OpenSpec gives a system of agents structured contracts to work against and verify.

### How is this different from Kiro's spec system?

Kiro also generates specs — user stories with acceptance criteria, design documents, and task lists. It's the closest approach to OpenSpec in the market. The differences:

- **Generation vs. orchestration.** Kiro generates specs within one IDE session for one agent to implement. OpenSpec generates specs AND decomposes them into a dependency DAG for parallel multi-agent execution.
- **Persistence model.** Kiro specs live in `.kiro/specs/` and are consumed within the IDE. OpenSpec specs are versioned artifacts that sync across worktrees, survive archiving, and build a living specification library (363 specs in set-core itself).
- **Delta specs.** OpenSpec has a unique concept: each change creates *delta specifications* (incremental ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED requirements) that sync into main specs after merge. Multiple changes can touch the same capability without conflicting.
- **Verification.** OpenSpec has automated verification (completeness, correctness, coherence) with traceability matrices. Kiro's quality enforcement is through file-event hooks, not spec-level verification.

### What are delta specs?

When a change is created (e.g., `add-user-auth`), its spec files live in `openspec/changes/add-user-auth/specs/`. These are *delta specifications* — the incremental requirements this specific change introduces, using ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED markers.

After merge, delta specs sync into *main specs* (`openspec/specs/`) — the single source of truth for each capability. This means:

- Each change only describes what *it* changes, not the entire system.
- Multiple changes can touch the same capability without conflicting at the spec level.
- Main specs evolve incrementally as changes merge.
- The full history is preserved in archived changes.

### What does the artifact workflow look like in practice?

```
/opsx:explore   → Think through the problem (read-only, no artifacts)
/opsx:new       → Create change container, scaffold artifact templates
/opsx:continue  → Create ONE artifact at a time (respects dependency DAG)
/opsx:apply     → Implement tasks from tasks.md
/opsx:verify    → Check completeness, correctness, coherence
/opsx:archive   → Move to archive, sync specs

Or fast-track: /opsx:ff → generates all artifacts in one pass
```

Each artifact depends on the previous: proposal → specs → design → tasks. You can't create tasks before design, because design decisions inform task structure. This is schema-driven — the default `spec-driven` schema enforces this ordering.

---

## Orchestration

### How does parallel execution actually work?

1. **Decompose**: The planner reads your spec, breaks it into independent changes, and creates a dependency DAG (e.g., "data-model" must merge before "product-pages").
2. **Dispatch**: For each change ready to run (dependencies satisfied, under `max_parallel` limit):
   - Create an isolated git worktree branched from main
   - Generate `input.md` with scope, requirements, design context
   - Bootstrap the environment (deps, ports, env files)
   - Start the Ralph Loop (autonomous Claude Code agent iterating until done)
3. **Monitor**: Every 15 seconds, check each agent's status (progress, stall, crash, budget).
4. **Verify**: When an agent reports "done", run the gate pipeline (build → test → E2E → review).
5. **Merge**: Changes passing gates enter the merge queue. Sequential merge with conflict resolution.
6. **Sync**: After each merge, all other running worktrees pull main to stay current.
7. **Replan**: After all planned changes merge, check for uncovered requirements and generate new changes if gaps remain.

### Why git worktrees instead of cloud VMs?

Worktrees provide true filesystem isolation without the overhead of cloud infrastructure:

- Each agent has its own working directory — no file conflicts during parallel development.
- Each agent has its own branch — git history is clean and independent.
- Worktrees share the same `.git` directory — no disk waste from full clones.
- Agents can independently install deps, run tests, and build without interfering with each other.
- Everything runs locally — no cloud costs, no network latency, full control.

This is fundamentally different from agents sharing a workspace and "coordinating" via messages — that approach breaks down when agents edit the same files simultaneously.

**Trade-off vs. cloud VMs (Cursor BGA, Devin, Copilot):** Cloud agents can run without your machine being on. SET requires a running machine. For overnight runs this matters — SET needs an always-on server or workstation.

### What happens when agents conflict?

Multi-layer conflict resolution:

1. **Preventive**: The dependency DAG orders changes so cross-cutting modifications happen sequentially. Profile-defined `cross_cutting_files()` (e.g., `package.json`, `.env.local`) are serialized.
2. **Generated files**: Lockfiles, `.tsbuildinfo`, build artifacts — auto-resolved with `--ours`, then `pnpm install` regenerates.
3. **Real conflicts**: Source code conflicts cause `merge-blocked` status. The sentinel investigates, may redispatch with retry context, or escalate.
4. **Post-merge sync**: After every merge, all running worktrees pull main immediately. This prevents integration skew.

In practice: CraftBrew (15 parallel changes) had 4 merge conflicts — all auto-resolved. MiniShop (6 changes): zero conflicts.

### What is the sentinel?

An AI supervisor that watches the orchestration and handles what goes wrong. It's a separate agent from the orchestrator — a supervisor/subordinate pattern.

| Event | Sentinel Action |
|---|---|
| Agent crash | Diagnose from logs, restart or escalate |
| Agent stall (>120s no update) | Investigate cause, attempt recovery |
| Periodic checkpoint | Auto-approve (routine) or escalate (unusual) |
| Orchestration complete | Generate summary report |
| Budget overrun | Pause agent, escalate |

Cost: minimal — typically 5-10 LLM calls per entire orchestration run. The sentinel saves hours of wasted compute by catching crashes that would otherwise silently waste an overnight run.

### What is the Ralph Loop?

The autonomous agent cycle running inside each worktree. When dispatched, an agent:

1. Reads the change's `input.md` (orchestrator's brief) and OpenSpec artifacts
2. Creates artifacts if needed (proposal → specs → design → tasks)
3. Implements each task from `tasks.md`
4. Marks tasks complete (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
5. Iterates until all tasks done (up to 20 iterations by default)

The monitor tracks progress via `loop-state.json`, detecting stalls (agent doing the same thing repeatedly) and budget limits.

---

## Quality & Verification

### What are integration gates?

Deterministic quality checks that every change must pass before merging. The key word is *deterministic* — exit codes, not LLM judgment.

| Gate | What it checks | How |
|---|---|---|
| **build** | Code compiles, types check | `tsc --noEmit`, `next build` — exit code 0/1 |
| **test** | Unit/integration tests pass | `vitest run`, `pytest`, `jest --ci` — exit code 0/1 |
| **e2e** | Browser tests pass | `playwright test`, `cypress run` — exit code 0/1 |
| **scope_check** | Files match declared scope | Validates changed files against change scope |
| **test_files** | Test files present | Ensures test files exist for implemented code |
| **review** | Code quality, security, patterns | Claude code review — no CRITICAL findings |
| **rules** | Custom compliance rules | Profile-defined rules (e.g., naming, patterns) |
| **spec_verify** | Requirements addressed | All assigned REQ-IDs have corresponding tasks |
| **smoke** | Post-merge sanity | Custom command (e.g., HTTP health check) — runs after merge |

9 gates total, all profile-configurable. Gates run sequentially (fast gates first for early failure). If a gate fails, the agent receives the error output and retries (up to 3 retries by default). No human intervention needed — agents self-heal from test failures, type errors, and build issues.

### How is this different from just running CI after a PR?

CI/CD validates code *after* a PR exists. SET's gates run *before* merge — the agent receives gate failures and self-heals before the code ever reaches main. This is the difference:

- **Copilot/Devin/Cursor:** Agent creates PR → CI runs → CI fails → human notices → human tells agent to fix → repeat.
- **SET:** Agent reports "done" → gate runs → gate fails → agent receives error → agent fixes → gate re-runs → passes → merge.

The feedback loop is automated and internal. No human in the loop for routine failures.

### Why not just trust the LLM's judgment?

Because LLMs hallucinate confidence. "Looks good to me" from a code review is not the same as `vitest run` returning exit code 0.

In MiniShop's 6 merged changes, there were 5 gate retries — all self-healed:
1. Missing test file → test gate caught it, agent added the file
2. Jest config issue → build gate caught import error, agent fixed path
3. Playwright auth test failures (3x) → agent updated tests to match actual behavior
4. Post-merge type error → agent synced main, resolved mismatch
5. Cart test race condition → agent added `waitForSelector`

An LLM review would have said "looks good" for at least 3 of these. The gates caught real bugs.

### What does verification check?

Three dimensions:

1. **Completeness**: All tasks done? All acceptance criteria met? All requirements traced to implementation?
2. **Correctness**: Do implementations match spec requirements? Are WHEN/THEN scenarios covered?
3. **Coherence**: Do code changes follow design decisions? Any scope overshoot? Pattern consistency?

Output: detailed report with traceability matrix, issues categorized as CRITICAL/WARNING/SUGGESTION, and a final PASS/FAIL verdict.

### How do you measure output quality across runs?

Structural convergence — measured by the `set-compare` tool. Run the same spec twice independently, compare route coverage, schema equivalence, dependency overlap, and convention compliance:

- **MiniShop**: 83/100 convergence score (routes, schemas, component hierarchy match)
- **Range across projects**: 83-87% structural convergence
- **100% schema equivalence, 100% convention compliance** in all measured runs

Remaining divergence is stylistic (variable naming, CSS order), not structural. The spec + template system produces deterministic architecture even with non-deterministic LLMs.

## Memory & Learning

### How does persistent memory work?

Through Claude Code's own per-repository memory: Markdown files under
`~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`, indexed by `MEMORY.md`. Only the **first 200 lines
(25 KB)** of that index load at session start; the topic files are read on demand. `/memory`
browses and edits it, `/context` shows what actually loaded.

SET adds no memory layer of its own. Writing a memory is deliberate — there is no automatic
capture.

### SET used to have its own memory system. What happened to it?

It was removed on 2026-08-22, and the reason is worth stating plainly because the obvious
assumption is the wrong one.

It was not removed for being redundant. It was removed for being **wrong in a way nothing
reported**. Over 21 days and 4958 session transcripts, it injected 187 memory lines into
sessions. **168 of them (89.8 %) were `User frustrated` records** — its sentiment detector
fired on exclamation marks, so a user writing *"exactly what I wanted!!!"* was recorded, and
later replayed into an unrelated session, as anger. Their payloads were not knowledge at all:
raw task notifications, other agents' system prompts, meeting-transcript fragments captured
verbatim from whatever prompt was in flight. **Exactly one line in 187 was a reusable fact.**

Three supporting measurements, each of which had been true for months without anyone
noticing, because all three fail toward a reassuring empty:

- Its knowledge graph held **0 nodes and 0 edges** from 56 memories through 7864, so the
  `causal` and `associative` recall modes were aliases of plain semantic search.
- `export` returned `count: 0` and exited 0 whenever the daemon held the database lock —
  there had never been a working backup, and an empty backup looks like a successful one.
- `list --limit N` returned `[]` for N ≥ 58, so the store could not be enumerated past 57
  records.

And the comparison that settled it: in one project both systems ran side by side. Every
remembered fact a session actually **acted on** traced to a hand-written file in the native
memory. The same facts appeared **zero times** in that project's 120 injection blocks from
the framework's own system.

### So what was lost?

Genuinely: semantic recall, tag filtering, temporal queries, full-text search, cross-device
sync, version history, and automatic session-end extraction. The removed system had **all
seven** — and produced one useful line in 187 injections.

That is the point worth carrying away. A memory layer's value is not the number of
capabilities it advertises; it is what reaches the model and gets used. Searching now means
reading the index and opening the file it names, and if one of the seven turns out to be
genuinely needed, it comes back as its own change — measured against the native layer rather
than against a vacuum.


## Architecture & Extensibility

### What is the plugin system?

SET separates abstract orchestration (Layer 1: `lib/set_orch/`) from project-specific knowledge (Layer 2: `modules/`).

- **Layer 1 (Core)**: Dispatcher, monitor, merger, gates, profiles — no project-specific logic. Works for any project type.
- **Layer 2 (Modules)**: `modules/web/` knows about Next.js, Playwright, Prisma. `modules/example/` is the reference plugin (Dungeon Builder game).
- **Layer 3 (External plugins)**: Your own project type in a separate repo. `pip install` + `entry_points` registration. Takes priority over built-in modules.

Each module implements the `ProjectType` ABC: `detect_test_command()`, `detect_e2e_command()`, `get_forbidden_patterns()`, `get_verification_rules()`, custom gates, merge strategies, planning rules. This means a `set-project-fintech` plugin could add IDOR scanning, PCI compliance checks, and financial calculation verification — all as gates in the merge pipeline.

### Can I use this without Claude Code?

No — the **harness** stays Claude Code. SET is built specifically for it and goes deeper into its capabilities (worktrees, hooks, MCP, skills, subagents); the orchestration, gates, and state management assume that tool surface.

**The model behind the harness is not fixed, though.** A single machine-level `providers.json` declares providers and credentials with per-project overrides — GLM and a gateway-backed ChatGPT/Codex plan are measured and shipped (endpoints, context-window launch parameters, and the known failure modes are documented), and a missing configuration stops loudly rather than falling back silently. What SET deliberately does not do is abstract over the tool harness: tools like Aider, Roo Code, and Cline support any CLI. SET bets on Claude Code and compounds that bet. See [provider configuration](../reference/configuration.md#provider-configuration-providersjson).

### Can this run on-premise?

The infrastructure is designed for it. SET is self-hosted — no SaaS dependency. When on-premise Claude models become available for regulated industries (banks, defense, government), SET's architecture works unchanged. The orchestration engine, gates, and state management have no cloud dependency. Only the LLM inference endpoint needs to be configured.

### How does design system integration work?

SET can integrate design tokens and visual specifications:

1. **Export from design tool** → `design-system.md` (tokens: colors, fonts, spacing) + `design-brief.md` (per-page visual descriptions)
2. **Dispatcher scope-matches** relevant pages to each change → per-change `design.md`
3. **Agent receives** exact hex colors, font names, component layouts
4. **Review gate checks** design compliance — token mismatches are flagged

This eliminates the "shadcn defaults everywhere" problem. Agents implement *your* brand, not a generic component library.

## What SET Doesn't Do (Yet)

Honest gaps where competitors are ahead — these inform our development roadmap:

| Gap | Who does it better | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud execution** | Cursor BGA, Devin, Copilot | SET requires a running local machine. Cloud agents work while you sleep. |
| **Model flexibility** | Aider, Roo Code, Cline | The harness is Claude Code by design; the model behind it is switchable per machine/project via `providers.json` (GLM and a ChatGPT/Codex plan shipped and measured). No per-call model router. |
| **IDE integration** | Kiro, Cursor, Windsurf | SET is CLI + web dashboard. No VS Code/JetBrains plugin for in-editor orchestration control. |
| **Zero-setup simplicity** | Copilot, Cline, Cursor | SET requires pip install, project init, orchestration config. Others are install-and-go. |
| **GitHub Issue → PR** | Copilot Coding Agent | SET works from specs, not from issue trackers. No native Jira/Linear/GitHub Issue integration. |
| **Slack integration** | Devin | Can't trigger SET orchestration from Slack. |
| **File-event hooks** | Kiro | SET's hooks are at the orchestration level, not IDE file-save events. |
| **MCP marketplace** | Cline | SET has a custom MCP server, but no marketplace for discovering third-party integrations. |
| **Quick prototyping** | Lovable, Cursor, Claude Code | SET's spec-driven workflow adds upfront overhead. For a quick prototype, just using Claude Code directly is faster. |
| **Spec writing** | — | The spec is a bottleneck: orchestration quality is bounded by spec quality. Writing a good spec takes effort. |

These are conscious trade-offs, not oversights. SET optimizes for orchestration depth over integration breadth. The overhead cost is real — SET is not for quick prototypes. It's for when you already know what to build and want deterministic, reproducible implementation. Some gaps may become development priorities as the framework matures.

## Practical

### What does a spec need to contain?

Your spec is the single most important input. The orchestration is only as good as the specification. Required sections:

1. **Project overview** — What is this? Who is it for? Tech stack?
2. **Data model** — Entities, fields, relationships (becomes Prisma schema)
3. **Page layouts** — Structure of each page (sections, columns, components)
4. **Component behavior** — Interactive elements (click, hover, state changes)
5. **Auth & roles** — Who can do what? Protected routes?
6. **Seed data** — Initial data with realistic values (not "Product 1")
7. **Design tokens** — Brand colors (hex), fonts, spacing
8. **E2E test expectations** — Critical flows to test

Each requirement needs a **REQ-ID** (`REQ-AUTH-01`) and at least one **WHEN/THEN scenario**. This enables automated spec coverage tracking and verification.

### How long does an orchestration take?

Depends on spec complexity:

| Project | Changes | Wall time | Tokens | Human interventions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Micro-Web** (simple) | 3-4 | ~45m | ~1M | 0 |
| **MiniShop** (e-commerce) | 6 | 1h 45m | 2.7M | 0 |
| **CraftBrew** (complex app) | 15 | ~6h | ~11M | 0 |

Token scaling is super-linear (4x tokens for 2.5x changes) because later changes require more context from merged code.

### What are the self-healing capabilities?

When a gate fails, the agent receives the error output and retries automatically:

- **Test failure**: Agent reads the test error, fixes the code or test, reruns
- **Build error**: Agent reads the type/compilation error, fixes it
- **E2E failure**: Agent sees the Playwright trace, updates selectors or waits
- **Post-merge type mismatch**: Agent syncs main, resolves conflicts

Sentinel-level recovery:
- **Agent crash**: Sentinel detects dead PID within 30s, restarts
- **Agent stall**: Watchdog detects identical action hashes, escalates (warn → restart → redispatch → fail)
- **Orphaned worktree**: Cleaned up on restart

### How do I get started?

```bash
# Install SET
pip install -e .
pip install -e modules/web

# Initialize a project
set-project init --name my-app --project-type web --template nextjs

# Write your spec (docs/spec.md)

# Start orchestration via manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:7400/api/my-app/sentinel/start \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"spec":"docs/spec.md"}'
```

Or use the step-by-step approach:
```
/opsx:explore   → Think through the problem
/opsx:ff mychange → Generate all artifacts
/opsx:apply     → Implement
/opsx:verify    → Check
/opsx:archive   → Done
```

See the [Quick Start guide](../guide/quick-start.md) for the full walkthrough.

## The Big Picture

### What problem does SET actually solve?

The gap between "AI can write code" and "AI can ship software." Writing code is 20% of the work. The other 80% is: decomposing requirements, coordinating parallel work, handling conflicts, running quality checks, managing merge order, recovering from failures, and learning from mistakes. SET automates the 80%.

### Why specs instead of prompts?

Because "build a webshop" produces a different webshop every time. "Build a webshop with these 28 data models, these 12 pages with this layout, these design tokens, these auth rules, these seed data records, and these E2E test scenarios" produces the same webshop every time. The spec is the determinism layer that makes LLM output reproducible.

MiniShop achieves 83/100 structural convergence score across independent runs from the same spec (measured by `set-compare`). Without specs, convergence approaches 0%.

### How is this different from just running CI/CD?

CI/CD validates code *after* a human (or AI) creates a PR. SET manages the entire pipeline *before* the PR exists:

- **CI/CD**: PR created → tests run → review → merge
- **SET**: Spec written → decomposed → agents dispatched → gates enforced → merge managed → gaps replanned

CI/CD assumes someone creates the PR. SET creates the PRs, validates them, merges them, and identifies what's still missing.

### Why not abstract over multiple LLMs?

Because depth beats breadth. SET leverages Claude-specific capabilities: 200K+ context for large codebases, native tool use for file operations, worktree support for isolation, hooks for memory injection, MCP for external integrations. Abstracting to a lowest-common-denominator API would sacrifice these capabilities for theoretical portability. SET bets on Claude getting better — and compounds that bet.

This is a trade-off. If Claude Code changes its API, SET's harness commitment becomes a liability. The model side of that bet is now hedged — `providers.json` swaps the model behind the same harness — but the harness risk itself we accept for the depth advantage.

### What's the competitive moat?

The combination. No other tool provides *all six*:

1. **Structured specs** with traceable requirements
2. **Parallel agents** in isolated worktrees
3. **Deterministic quality gates** (exit codes, not vibes)
4. **Automated merge pipeline** with conflict resolution
5. **Sentinel supervision** with crash recovery
6. **Persistent memory** that improves across runs

Most tools have 1-2 of these. The closest competitors (Kiro for specs, Cursor for parallel agents, Copilot for cloud execution) have 2-3 each. The value is in the integration — the six capabilities reinforce each other. Structured specs enable meaningful gates. Gates enable autonomous merging. Memory enables learning. The sentinel enables unattended operation.

The moat is not any single feature — it's the assembled system and the 200+ production runs of battle-testing that validate it works together.
