## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Merge worktree branch to target
The `wt-merge` command SHALL merge a worktree's branch into a target branch with multi-layer automatic conflict resolution.

#### Scenario: Basic merge
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-merge <change-id>`
- **THEN** the system SHALL resolve the project and worktree path
- **AND** determine the source branch from the worktree HEAD
- **AND** auto-detect the target branch (main or master)
- **AND** fetch, checkout target, pull latest, then merge the source branch

#### Scenario: Squash merge
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-merge <change-id> --squash`
- **THEN** the system SHALL squash all commits into one merge commit

#### Scenario: Custom target branch
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-merge <change-id> --to develop`
- **THEN** the system SHALL merge into the `develop` branch instead of main/master

#### Scenario: No push after merge
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-merge <change-id> --no-push`
- **THEN** the system SHALL NOT push to origin after merge

#### Scenario: Keep source branch
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-merge <change-id> --no-delete`
- **THEN** the source branch SHALL NOT be deleted after merge

### Requirement: Multi-layer conflict resolution
The merge command SHALL attempt conflict resolution in a specific order, escalating from cheapest to most expensive.

#### Scenario: Resolution order
- **WHEN** a merge produces conflicts
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt resolution in this order:
  1. Auto-resolve generated/build files (accept "ours")
  2. Programmatic package.json deep merge (jq-based)
  3. Programmatic JSON file deep merge (translation/config files)
  4. LLM-based conflict resolution (only with `--llm-resolve` flag)
- **AND** after each step, check if conflicts remain before proceeding to the next

### Requirement: Generated file auto-resolution
The system SHALL auto-resolve conflicts in generated/build files by accepting the target branch version ("ours").

#### Scenario: Generated file patterns
- **WHEN** a conflicted file matches a generated file pattern (tsconfig.tsbuildinfo, lock files, dist/**, build/**, .next/**, .claude/reflection.md)
- **THEN** the conflict SHALL be resolved with `git checkout --ours` and staged

#### Scenario: Partial mode with LLM resolve
- **WHEN** `--llm-resolve` is active and conflicts include both generated and non-generated files
- **THEN** generated files SHALL be auto-resolved even though non-generated conflicts remain

### Requirement: Programmatic package.json deep merge
The system SHALL resolve package.json conflicts using jq-based recursive deep merge.

#### Scenario: Additive dependency conflict
- **WHEN** both branches add different dependencies to package.json
- **THEN** the deep merge SHALL keep entries from both sides
- **AND** for scalar conflicts, prefer the source branch (feature being merged)

#### Scenario: Invalid JSON
- **WHEN** either branch's package.json is not valid JSON
- **THEN** the programmatic merge SHALL skip and fall through to the next resolution layer

### Requirement: Programmatic JSON file deep merge
The system SHALL resolve conflicts in non-package.json JSON files (translation files, config files) using the same jq deep merge strategy.

#### Scenario: Translation file conflict
- **WHEN** a `.json` file (not package.json) has merge conflicts
- **THEN** the system SHALL attempt jq deep merge with the same additive strategy

### Requirement: LLM-based conflict resolution
When `--llm-resolve` flag is active, the system SHALL use Claude to resolve remaining conflicts.

#### Scenario: LLM prompt construction
- **WHEN** LLM resolution is attempted
- **THEN** the system SHALL extract only conflict hunks with 3 lines of context (not entire files) to minimize prompt size
- **AND** include additive pattern guidance in the prompt

#### Scenario: Model escalation
- **WHEN** total conflict lines exceed 200
- **THEN** the system SHALL use opus directly (skip sonnet)
- **WHEN** total conflict lines are 200 or fewer
- **THEN** the system SHALL try sonnet first, escalate to opus on failure

#### Scenario: LLM output parsing
- **WHEN** LLM returns resolved files
- **THEN** the system SHALL parse `--- FILE: <path> ---` headers and write each file's content
- **AND** verify no conflict markers remain after resolution

### Requirement: Pre-merge state management
The system SHALL handle uncommitted changes in both worktree and main repo before merging.

#### Scenario: Uncommitted non-generated changes in worktree
- **WHEN** the worktree has uncommitted changes in non-generated files
- **THEN** the system SHALL auto-commit them with message "chore: auto-commit remaining changes before merge"

#### Scenario: Uncommitted generated changes in worktree
- **WHEN** the worktree has uncommitted changes only in generated files
- **THEN** the system SHALL auto-stash them

#### Scenario: Uncommitted changes in main repo
- **WHEN** the main repo has uncommitted tracked changes
- **THEN** the system SHALL stash them before merge and restore after

### Requirement: Untracked file handling
The system SHALL handle untracked files that block merge.

#### Scenario: Untracked files would be overwritten
- **WHEN** git merge fails because untracked working tree files would be overwritten
- **THEN** the system SHALL remove the blocking untracked files
- **AND** retry the merge

### Requirement: Post-merge cleanup
The system SHALL push and clean up after successful merge.

#### Scenario: Push to origin
- **WHEN** merge succeeds and `--no-push` is not set
- **THEN** the system SHALL push the target branch to origin

#### Scenario: Delete source branch
- **WHEN** merge succeeds and `--no-delete` is not set
- **THEN** the system SHALL delete the source branch (force-delete for squash case)
- **AND** if branch is still checked out in worktree, inform user to run `wt-close`
