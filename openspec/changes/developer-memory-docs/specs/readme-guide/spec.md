#### Scenario: README follows section order
- **WHEN** the README is generated or updated following the guide
- **THEN** all mandatory sections are present in the specified order

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Developer Memory Feature Instructions
The guide's Features section (Section 6) SHALL include detailed generation instructions for the Developer Memory subsection, specifying: one-paragraph overview, three concrete examples (negative experience recall, OpenSpec automatic hooks, mid-flow learning), CLI quick-start commands, link to `docs/developer-memory.md`, and experimental status note.

#### Scenario: Feature section generation
- **WHEN** an LLM generates the Features section using the guide
- **THEN** the Developer Memory subsection includes an overview paragraph, concrete examples, and a link to the deep-dive doc

### Requirement: Developer Memory Use Case Instructions
The guide's Use Cases section (Section 13) SHALL include instructions for a "Developer Memory" use case covering: scenario showing memory saving and recall across sessions, OpenSpec integration scenario (automatic recall at change start), and a "When to use what" table entry for memory.

#### Scenario: Use case generation
- **WHEN** an LLM generates the Use Cases section using the guide
- **THEN** a Developer Memory use case appears with cross-session recall scenario and OpenSpec integration scenario

### Requirement: Developer Memory CLI Reference Instructions
The guide's CLI Reference section (Section 8) SHALL list the Developer Memory category with all `wt-memory` and `wt-memory-hooks` user-facing commands, requiring a one-line description for each.

#### Scenario: CLI reference completeness
- **WHEN** an LLM generates the CLI Reference following the guide
- **THEN** the Developer Memory category includes `wt-memory remember`, `wt-memory recall`, `wt-memory list`, `wt-memory status`, `wt-memory-hooks install`, and `wt-memory-hooks check`
