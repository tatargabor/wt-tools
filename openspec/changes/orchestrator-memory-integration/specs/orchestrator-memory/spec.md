## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Helper functions for orchestrator memory access
The orchestrator SHALL provide `orch_remember` and `orch_recall` helper functions that encapsulate wt-memory CLI access with consistent tagging, availability checks, and failure handling.

#### Scenario: orch_remember saves with orchestrator tags
- **WHEN** `orch_remember "merge conflict between X and Y" Learning "phase:merge,change:my-change"` is called
- **THEN** the content SHALL be saved via `wt-memory remember` with type `Learning` and tags `source:orchestrator,phase:merge,change:my-change`
- **AND** the function SHALL return 0 regardless of wt-memory success or failure

#### Scenario: orch_remember when wt-memory is not installed
- **WHEN** `orch_remember` is called and `wt-memory` is not on PATH
- **THEN** the function SHALL return 0 immediately without error

#### Scenario: orch_recall retrieves filtered memories
- **WHEN** `orch_recall "merge conflicts" 3 "source:orchestrator,phase:merge"` is called
- **THEN** the function SHALL return memory content as plain text, limited to 2000 characters
- **AND** the function SHALL use hybrid recall mode

#### Scenario: orch_recall when wt-memory is not installed
- **WHEN** `orch_recall` is called and `wt-memory` is not on PATH
- **THEN** the function SHALL return empty string and exit 0

### Requirement: Orchestrator saves merge outcomes as memories
The orchestrator SHALL save a memory after each merge attempt with the outcome (success, conflict, or already-merged).

#### Scenario: Successful merge saved
- **WHEN** `merge_change()` successfully merges a change
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Context`, tags `phase:merge,change:<name>`, and content describing the successful merge including change name and iteration count

#### Scenario: Merge conflict saved
- **WHEN** `merge_change()` encounters a merge conflict
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Decision`, tags `phase:merge,change:<name>`, and content describing the conflict including change name
- **AND** the content SHALL note that this change conflicted so future planning can sequence it differently

#### Scenario: Merge conflict after max retries saved
- **WHEN** `retry_merge_queue()` exhausts all retry attempts for a change
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Decision`, tags `phase:merge,change:<name>`, and content noting permanent merge failure

### Requirement: Orchestrator saves test outcomes as memories
The orchestrator SHALL save a memory after each test execution with the pass/fail outcome.

#### Scenario: Test pass saved
- **WHEN** `handle_change_done()` runs tests and they pass
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Context`, tags `phase:test,change:<name>`, and content noting test success

#### Scenario: Test failure saved
- **WHEN** `handle_change_done()` runs tests and they fail
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Learning`, tags `phase:test,change:<name>`, and content including the change name and truncated test output (first 500 chars)

### Requirement: Orchestrator saves review outcomes as memories
The orchestrator SHALL save a memory after each code review with the outcome.

#### Scenario: Review pass saved
- **WHEN** `review_change()` completes with no CRITICAL issues
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Context`, tags `phase:review,change:<name>`, and content noting review passed

#### Scenario: Review with critical issues saved
- **WHEN** `review_change()` finds CRITICAL issues
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Learning`, tags `phase:review,change:<name>`, and content including the change name and truncated review output (first 500 chars)

### Requirement: Orchestrator saves stall/failure events as memories
The orchestrator SHALL save a memory when a change stalls or fails permanently.

#### Scenario: Change stall saved
- **WHEN** `poll_change()` detects a stalled/stuck change on the final retry attempt (attempt 3/3)
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Learning`, tags `phase:monitor,change:<name>`, and content noting the change stalled after 3 attempts

#### Scenario: Change failure saved
- **WHEN** a change transitions to `failed` status
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_remember` with type `Learning`, tags `phase:monitor,change:<name>`, and content noting the failure reason

### Requirement: Per-roadmap-item recall during planning
During `cmd_plan()`, the orchestrator SHALL recall memories specific to each roadmap item's scope text instead of using a single generic query.

#### Scenario: Brief mode per-item recall
- **WHEN** `cmd_plan()` operates in brief mode with multiple roadmap items
- **THEN** for each item, the orchestrator SHALL call `orch_recall` with the item's scope text as query and no tag filter (to capture both agent and orchestrator memories)
- **AND** the combined recalled context SHALL be injected into the planning prompt as `## Project Memory`

#### Scenario: Spec mode recall
- **WHEN** `cmd_plan()` operates in spec mode
- **THEN** the orchestrator SHALL recall using the spec summary or phase hint as query
- **AND** additionally recall `source:orchestrator` tagged memories for operational context

#### Scenario: Recall produces no results
- **WHEN** recall returns empty for all items
- **THEN** the `## Project Memory` section SHALL be omitted from the prompt (not included as empty)

### Requirement: Replan recalls orchestrator operational history
During `auto_replan_cycle()`, the orchestrator SHALL recall memories from the current orchestration cycle to inform the replanning prompt.

#### Scenario: Replan with merge conflict history
- **WHEN** `auto_replan_cycle()` runs and past merge conflicts exist in memory
- **THEN** the recalled memories SHALL be injected into the planning prompt as `## Orchestration History`
- **AND** the section SHALL appear after the completed items context

#### Scenario: Replan recall query
- **WHEN** `auto_replan_cycle()` performs recall
- **THEN** the query SHALL be `"orchestration merge conflict test failure review"` with tags `source:orchestrator` and limit 5
- **AND** results SHALL be injected as `## Orchestration History` section via `_REPLAN_MEMORY` env var

#### Scenario: Replan with no orchestrator memories
- **WHEN** `auto_replan_cycle()` recalls and no orchestrator memories exist
- **THEN** the `## Orchestration History` section SHALL be omitted

### Requirement: Dispatch enriches proposal with recalled memories
When `dispatch_change()` creates a proposal.md in a worktree, it SHALL recall memories relevant to the change scope and append them to the proposal.

#### Scenario: Dispatch with relevant memories
- **WHEN** `dispatch_change()` creates proposal.md for a change
- **AND** `orch_recall` returns non-empty content for the change scope
- **THEN** the proposal.md SHALL include a `## Context from Memory` section after the `## Impact` section
- **AND** the section content SHALL be limited to 1000 characters

#### Scenario: Dispatch with no relevant memories
- **WHEN** `dispatch_change()` creates proposal.md for a change
- **AND** `orch_recall` returns empty for the change scope
- **THEN** proposal.md SHALL NOT include the `## Context from Memory` section

#### Scenario: Dispatch recall uses scope text
- **WHEN** `dispatch_change()` performs recall
- **THEN** the query SHALL use the change's scope text (not the kebab-case name)
- **AND** the recall SHALL NOT filter by `source:orchestrator` tags (to capture both agent and orchestrator memories)
