## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: JIRA settings tab (from Configuration Management)
**Reason**: JIRA integration removed entirely; will be reintroduced as a plugin
**Migration**: No migration needed — JIRA settings tab simply disappears from settings dialog

### Requirement: JIRA submenu (from Row Context Menu)
**Reason**: JIRA integration removed entirely; will be reintroduced as a plugin
**Migration**: No migration needed — JIRA submenu simply disappears from context menu
