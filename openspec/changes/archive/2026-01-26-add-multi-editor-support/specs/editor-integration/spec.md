- **THEN** xdotool searches for windows with class "Code"
- **AND** the window containing the worktree folder name is focused

#### Scenario: Focus Cursor window
- **WHEN** Cursor is the configured editor
- **AND** user runs `wt-focus <change-id>`
- **THEN** xdotool searches for windows with class "Cursor"
- **AND** the window containing the worktree folder name is focused

#### Scenario: Focus Windsurf window
- **WHEN** Windsurf is the configured editor
- **AND** user runs `wt-focus <change-id>`
- **THEN** xdotool searches for windows with class "Windsurf"
- **AND** the window containing the worktree folder name is focused

### Requirement: Editor Detection Fallback
