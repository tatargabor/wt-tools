# team-sync Specification

## Purpose

Git-based team synchronization for the Control Center. Makes visible who's working on what, which changes they're on, and warns about conflicts.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Control Branch Initialization

The system SHALL provide a command to initialize the team sync infrastructure.

#### Scenario: Initialize wt-control branch

- **GIVEN** a project with git repository
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-init`
- **THEN** an orphan branch named `wt-control` is created
- **AND** a hidden worktree `.wt-control/` is created in the project root
- **AND** directory structure `members/`, `queue/`, `chat/` is created
- **AND** `.wt-control/` is added to `.gitignore`

#### Scenario: Initialize from remote

- **GIVEN** `wt-control` branch exists on remote but not locally
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-init`
- **THEN** the branch is fetched from remote
- **AND** a local worktree is created tracking the remote branch

#### Scenario: Already initialized

- **GIVEN** `.wt-control/` worktree already exists
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-init`
- **THEN** an error is shown: "wt-control already initialized"
- **AND** hint: "Use --force to re-initialize"

#### Scenario: Force re-initialization

- **GIVEN** `.wt-control/` worktree exists
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-init --force`
- **THEN** the existing worktree and branch are removed
- **AND** a fresh orphan branch and worktree are created

#### Scenario: Push to remote

- **GIVEN** initialization is complete
- **WHEN** the branch doesn't exist on remote
- **THEN** the branch is pushed to origin
- **OR** a warning is shown if push fails

### Requirement: Member Status Sync

The system SHALL synchronize member status via the wt-control branch.

#### Scenario: Sync local status

- **GIVEN** wt-control is initialized
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-sync`
- **THEN** member status is written to `members/{name}.json`
- **AND** the JSON includes: name, display_name, hostname, status, changes, last_seen

#### Scenario: Member name format

- **GIVEN** git user.name is "John Smith" and hostname is "WorkStation"
- **WHEN** member status is generated
- **THEN** `name` is "john-smith@workstation" (sanitized, lowercase)
- **AND** `display_name` is "John Smith@WorkStation" (original case)

#### Scenario: Pull before sync

- **GIVEN** wt-control is initialized
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-sync --pull`
- **THEN** `git pull --rebase` is executed first
- **AND** then local status is synced

#### Scenario: Push after sync

- **GIVEN** wt-control is initialized
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-sync --push`
- **THEN** local status is synced
- **AND** `git push` is executed after

#### Scenario: Full sync mode

- **GIVEN** wt-control is initialized
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-sync --full`
- **THEN** pull, sync, and push are executed in order

#### Scenario: JSON output

- **GIVEN** wt-control is initialized with member data
- **WHEN** the user runs `wt-control-sync --json`
- **THEN** output is JSON with: `my_name`, `members[]`, `conflicts[]`

#### Scenario: Commit amend for same member

- **GIVEN** last commit was from the same member
- **WHEN** `wt-control-sync` creates a new commit
- **THEN** the previous commit is amended (to reduce history noise)

### Requirement: Conflict Detection

The system SHALL detect when multiple members work on the same change.

#### Scenario: Detect change-id conflict

- **GIVEN** john has `add-feature` in changes
- **AND** peter has `add-feature` in changes
- **WHEN** `wt-control-sync --json` is called
- **THEN** `conflicts` array contains: `{change_id: "add-feature", members: ["john@...", "peter@..."]}`

#### Scenario: No conflict

- **GIVEN** john has `add-auth` and peter has `fix-bug`
- **WHEN** `wt-control-sync --json` is called
- **THEN** `conflicts` array is empty

### Requirement: GUI Team Status Display

The GUI SHALL display team member status in the main window.
