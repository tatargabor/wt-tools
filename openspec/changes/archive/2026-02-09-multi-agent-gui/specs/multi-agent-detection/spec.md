## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Agent Detection
The system SHALL detect ALL Claude agent processes associated with a worktree, not just the first one found.

#### Scenario: Single agent on worktree
- **WHEN** one Claude process has its CWD in a worktree directory
- **THEN** `wt-status --json` returns an `agents` array with one entry containing `pid`, `status`, and `skill`

#### Scenario: Multiple agents on worktree
- **WHEN** two or more Claude processes have their CWD in the same worktree directory
- **THEN** `wt-status --json` returns an `agents` array with one entry per process, each with its own `pid`, `status`, and `skill`

#### Scenario: No agents on worktree
- **WHEN** no Claude process has its CWD in a worktree directory
- **THEN** `wt-status --json` returns an empty `agents` array `[]`

#### Scenario: Per-agent status determination
- **WHEN** multiple agents exist on a worktree
- **THEN** each agent's status (running/waiting/compacting) is determined independently using the N most recently modified session files matched to PIDs by mtime order

### Requirement: Per-PID Skill Tracking
The system SHALL track skills per agent PID rather than per worktree.

#### Scenario: Register skill for specific agent
- **WHEN** `wt-skill-start <skill-name>` is called
- **THEN** a file `.wt-tools/agents/<pid>.skill` is created with format `<skill-name>|<timestamp>`
- **AND** the PID used is the caller's parent process PID (`$PPID`)

#### Scenario: Read skill per agent
- **WHEN** `wt-status` reads skill information for a worktree
- **THEN** it checks `.wt-tools/agents/<pid>.skill` for each detected agent PID
- **AND** returns the skill name if the file exists and is fresh (< 30 minutes)

#### Scenario: Stale PID cleanup
- **WHEN** `wt-status` reads `.wt-tools/agents/` directory
- **THEN** for each `.skill` file, it verifies the PID is alive using `kill -0 <pid>`
- **AND** removes files for dead PIDs

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility of wt-skill-start
- **WHEN** `wt-skill-start` writes a new per-PID skill file
- **THEN** it also writes the legacy `.wt-tools/current_skill` file for any consumers that haven't been updated

### Requirement: Multi-Agent JSON Format
The `wt-status --json` output SHALL use an `agents` array instead of a single `agent` object.

#### Scenario: JSON format with agents array
- **WHEN** `wt-status --json` is called
- **THEN** each worktree object contains `"agents": [{"pid": <int>, "status": "<status>", "skill": <string|null>}, ...]` instead of `"agent": {"status": "<status>", "skill": <string|null>}`

#### Scenario: Summary counts reflect agent count
- **WHEN** `wt-status --json` produces the summary object
- **THEN** the `running`, `waiting`, `compacting`, and `idle` counts reflect the total number of agents in each state across all worktrees (not worktree count)
