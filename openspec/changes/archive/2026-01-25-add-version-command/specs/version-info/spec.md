  - Commit hash (short, 7 chars)
  - Commit date (ISO format)
  - Source directory path

#### Scenario: JSON output

When the user runs `wt-version --json`
Then the output is valid JSON with fields: branch, commit, date, source_dir

#### Scenario: Source not found
Given wt-version script symlink is broken
When the user runs `wt-version`
Then an error message explains the source directory was not found

### Requirement: Install Script Update
