## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Resolve effective model for change
The system SHALL resolve the implementation model using three-tier priority: (1) explicit per-change model from state, (2) complexity-based routing when enabled, (3) default model from directive. Doc-named changes (doc-*, *-doc-*, *-docs, *-docs-*) SHALL always route to sonnet. Sonnet SHALL be overridden to opus for non-doc code changes.

#### Scenario: Explicit per-change model
- **WHEN** a change has an explicit model field in state
- **THEN** that model is used (unless sonnet for non-doc change, which overrides to opus)

#### Scenario: Complexity-based routing
- **WHEN** model_routing is "complexity" and change is S-complexity non-feature
- **THEN** the change routes to sonnet

#### Scenario: Doc change always sonnet
- **WHEN** change name matches doc-* or *-docs pattern
- **THEN** model resolves to sonnet regardless of other settings

#### Scenario: Default model fallback
- **WHEN** no explicit model and no routing match
- **THEN** the default model from directive is used

### Requirement: Dispatch change to worktree
The system SHALL create a worktree via `wt-new`, bootstrap it, prune orchestrator context, build proposal.md with scope/memory/project-knowledge/sibling context, and launch wt-loop. Token counters SHALL be reset on fresh dispatch. If worktree already exists, stale loop state SHALL be cleaned up.

#### Scenario: Fresh dispatch
- **WHEN** dispatch_change is called for a pending change with no existing worktree
- **THEN** worktree is created, bootstrapped, proposal.md written, wt-loop started, status set to "running"

#### Scenario: Existing worktree reuse
- **WHEN** worktree directory already exists at expected path
- **THEN** stale loop-state.json is cleaned up if PID is dead, worktree is reused

#### Scenario: Worktree creation failure
- **WHEN** wt-new fails
- **THEN** change status is set to "failed" and function returns error

### Requirement: Dispatch via wt-loop backend
The system SHALL start wt-loop in a subshell, verify startup by polling for loop-state.json (up to 10 seconds), extract terminal PID, and update state with ralph_pid and status "running".

#### Scenario: Successful wt-loop start
- **WHEN** wt-loop is invoked and loop-state.json appears within 10 seconds
- **THEN** terminal_pid is extracted and change status is set to "running"

#### Scenario: wt-loop fails to start
- **WHEN** loop-state.json does not appear after 10 seconds
- **THEN** change status is set to "failed" and an ERROR event is emitted

### Requirement: Dispatch ready changes with scheduling
The system SHALL dispatch pending changes in topological order, gated by phase and max_parallel limit. Ready changes SHALL be sorted by complexity (L > M > S) to reduce tail latency.

#### Scenario: Dispatch within parallel limit
- **WHEN** running count is below max_parallel and pending changes have deps satisfied
- **THEN** changes are dispatched in complexity-sorted order until limit is reached

#### Scenario: Phase gating
- **WHEN** a change belongs to a future phase
- **THEN** it is skipped even if its deps are satisfied

### Requirement: Build proposal with enrichment context
The system SHALL enrich proposal.md with dispatch memory (from memory recall), project knowledge (feature touches, cross-cutting files), sibling change status, design context, digest mode spec references, and retry context for redispatched changes.

#### Scenario: Proposal with project knowledge
- **WHEN** project-knowledge.yaml exists and change scope matches a feature
- **THEN** feature touches and cross-cutting files are appended to proposal

#### Scenario: Proposal with retry context
- **WHEN** change has retry_context in state
- **THEN** retry context is appended to proposal and cleared from state
