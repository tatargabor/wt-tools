## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Change-aware query building
The recall hook detects completed changes from git commit history (parsing `change-name: description` format) and builds recall queries from those change names rather than from the raw prompt text.

#### Scenario: 4 of 6 changes committed
- **WHEN** git log contains commits with messages like `product-catalog: ...`, `shopping-cart: ...`, `multi-vendor: ...`, `discounts: ...`
- **AND** no commits exist for `checkout` or `order-workflow`
- **THEN** the recall query SHALL search for memories matching the completed change names extracted from commit messages

#### Scenario: No openspec directory
- **WHEN** the project has no `openspec/` directory
- **THEN** the hook falls back to prompt-based recall (first 200 chars of prompt text)

#### Scenario: No committed changes found
- **WHEN** git log contains no commits matching the `change-name: description` format
- **THEN** the hook falls back to prompt-based recall

### Requirement: Proactive context retrieval
The recall hook SHALL use `wt-memory proactive` instead of `wt-memory recall` for memory retrieval. The proactive command provides relevance-scored results without requiring carefully crafted queries. The hook SHALL pass the current change context (change name, revision notes, and recent prompt summary) as the conversation context to `wt-memory proactive`.

#### Scenario: Hook uses proactive on change boundary
- **WHEN** a change boundary is detected (new change differs from last-recall-change marker)
- **THEN** the hook calls `wt-memory proactive "<change-context>" --limit 8` instead of `wt-memory recall`

#### Scenario: Proactive with revision change context
- **WHEN** the current change is a revision change (e.g., stock-rethink revises shopping-cart)
- **THEN** the proactive context includes both the current change name and the original change context (e.g., "stock-rethink: revising shopping-cart, focus on cart stock variant checkout")

#### Scenario: Proactive command not available
- **WHEN** `wt-memory proactive` is not available (old wt-memory version)
- **THEN** the hook falls back to `wt-memory recall` with hybrid mode (current behavior preserved)

### Requirement: Actionable output format
The recall output is formatted as a concise bulleted list with an instruction header, not raw memory JSON.

#### Scenario: Recall returns 3 memories
- **WHEN** 3 memories are found for completed changes
- **THEN** output format is:
  ```
  === PROJECT MEMORY ===
  Previously completed changes — maintain consistency:
  • product-catalog: SQLite+Prisma, images as JSON string, auto-increment IDs
  • shopping-cart: Session-based cart, stock reservation with $transaction
  • multi-vendor: Optional vendorId migration, order split by vendor into SubOrders
  === END ===
  ```

#### Scenario: No memories found
- **WHEN** no memories match the query
- **THEN** no output is produced (silent exit)

#### Scenario: Proactive results include relevance info
- **WHEN** proactive retrieval returns memories with relevance_score
- **THEN** memories with relevance_score < 0.3 SHALL be filtered out before formatting

### Requirement: Timeout safety
The recall hook must complete within its 15-second timeout even if git log or wt-memory proactive is slow.

#### Scenario: wt-memory proactive hangs
- **WHEN** wt-memory proactive takes >10 seconds
- **THEN** the hook exits silently (killed by Claude Code timeout)
