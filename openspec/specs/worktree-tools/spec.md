# worktree-tools Specification

## Purpose
Core worktree lifecycle tools, project management, editor integration, Ralph Loop, installation, and cross-platform support.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Project Management
The system SHALL manage multiple git projects through a central registry.

#### Scenario: Initialize current directory as project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project init` inside a git repository
- **THEN** the repository is registered with its directory name as project name
- **AND** the project path is stored in `~/.config/wt-tools/projects.json`
- **AND** wt-tools hooks, commands, and skills are deployed to `<project>/.claude/`

#### Scenario: Initialize with custom name
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project init --name myproject` inside a git repository
- **THEN** the repository is registered with "myproject" as its name
- **AND** wt-tools hooks, commands, and skills are deployed to `<project>/.claude/`

#### Scenario: Init outside git repository
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project init` outside a git repository
- **THEN** an error is shown indicating the current directory is not a git repository

#### Scenario: Re-init already registered project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project init` in an already-registered project
- **THEN** registration is skipped
- **AND** wt-tools hooks, commands, and skills are updated to the current version

#### Scenario: List registered projects
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project list`
- **THEN** all registered projects are displayed with name and path
- **AND** the default project is marked

#### Scenario: Remove project from registry
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project remove myproject`
- **THEN** the project is removed from the registry
- **AND** existing worktrees are NOT deleted

#### Scenario: Set default project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-project default myproject`
- **THEN** "myproject" becomes the default for other wt-* commands

### Requirement: Worktree Creation
The system SHALL create a git worktree for a specified change-id in a standardized location.

#### Scenario: Create worktree for new change
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-open <change-id>` (uses default project or current directory)
- **THEN** a new git worktree is created at `../<repo-name>-wt-<change-id>`
- **AND** a new branch `change/<change-id>` is created if it doesn't exist
- **AND** `openspec init` is called in the new worktree if openspec is not initialized
- **AND** the worktree path is printed to stdout

#### Scenario: Create worktree for specific project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-open <change-id> -p <project-name>`
- **THEN** a worktree is created for the specified registered project

#### Scenario: Worktree already exists
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-open <change-id>` and worktree already exists
- **THEN** the existing worktree path is printed
- **AND** no error is raised

#### Scenario: Invalid change-id
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-open` without change-id
- **THEN** an error message is displayed with usage instructions

### Requirement: Add Existing Git Repository
The system SHALL allow users to register any existing git repository (worktree or standalone clone) with wt-tools via `wt-add`.

#### Scenario: Add a git worktree
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/worktree` where the path is a git worktree (`.git` is a file)
- **THEN** the worktree is registered in projects.json with `is_worktree: true`
- **AND** the main repo is resolved from the `.git` file's gitdir pointer

#### Scenario: Add a standalone git repository
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/repo` where the path is a regular git repo (`.git` is a directory)
- **THEN** the repository is registered in projects.json with `is_worktree: false`
- **AND** the repo itself is treated as its own main repo for project detection

#### Scenario: Add with explicit change-id
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/repo --as my-change`
- **THEN** the repository is registered with "my-change" as the change-id

#### Scenario: Add with explicit project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/repo -p myproject`
- **THEN** the repository is registered under the "myproject" project

#### Scenario: Change-id derivation for standalone repo
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/repo` without `--as` flag on a standalone git repo
- **THEN** change-id is derived from branch name patterns (`change/X`, `feature/X`) or directory name as fallback

#### Scenario: Directory is not a git repository
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/non-git-dir` where the directory is not a git repository
- **THEN** an error is displayed: "Not a git repository"
- **AND** the directory is NOT registered

#### Scenario: Bare repository rejected
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/bare-repo` where the directory is a bare git repository (no working tree)
- **THEN** an error is displayed indicating bare repositories are not supported

#### Scenario: Already registered
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-add /path/to/repo` and the path is already registered with the same change-id
- **THEN** a warning is shown that it's already registered
- **AND** no duplicate entry is created

### Requirement: GUI Add Button Accepts Git Repositories
The GUI "Add" button SHALL accept any valid git repository, not just worktrees.

#### Scenario: Add button opens folder browser
- **WHEN** user clicks the "Add" button in Control Center
- **THEN** a folder browser dialog opens with title "Select Git Repository"

#### Scenario: Add button tooltip
- **WHEN** user hovers over the "Add" button
- **THEN** the tooltip reads "Add existing repository or worktree"

#### Scenario: Successfully add a non-worktree repo via GUI
- **WHEN** user selects a standalone git repository directory in the folder browser
- **THEN** `wt-add` is called with the selected path
- **AND** the repo appears in the Control Center table after refresh

### Requirement: Editor Integration
The system SHALL open the Zed editor for a specified worktree.

#### Scenario: Open Zed for worktree
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-work <change-id>` with Zed as the active editor
- **THEN** Zed opens the worktree directory without the `-n` (new window) flag
- **AND** if the worktree path is already open in Zed, the existing window SHALL be focused
- **AND** if the worktree path is not open, a new window SHALL be created

#### Scenario: Zed not installed
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-work` and Zed is not found
- **THEN** an informative error message is displayed with installation instructions

### Requirement: Worktree Listing
The system SHALL list all active worktrees for projects.

#### Scenario: List worktrees for default project

- **THEN** all worktrees for all registered projects are listed
- **AND** each entry shows the project name, change-id and path

#### Scenario: List worktrees for specific project
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-list -p <project-name>`
- **THEN** worktrees for the specified project are listed

#### Scenario: No worktrees exist
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-list` and no worktrees exist
- **THEN** an informative message is displayed

### Requirement: Worktree Removal
The system SHALL remove a worktree and optionally its branch. For non-worktree repositories, the system SHALL only deregister them.

#### Scenario: Remove worktree
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-close <change-id>` on an entry with `is_worktree: true`
- **THEN** the worktree is removed via `git worktree remove`
- **AND** user is prompted whether to delete the branch

#### Scenario: Remove with force
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-close <change-id> --force` on an entry with `is_worktree: true`
- **THEN** the worktree and branch are removed without prompts

#### Scenario: Deregister non-worktree repository
- **WHEN** user runs `wt-close <change-id>` on an entry with `is_worktree: false`
- **THEN** the entry is removed from projects.json
- **AND** the repository directory is NOT deleted
