# control-center Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change add-control-center. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Status Command
The system SHALL provide a `wt-status` command that displays worktree and agent status.

#### Scenario: List all worktrees with status
Given multiple worktrees exist across projects
When the user runs `wt-status`
Then each worktree is shown with:
  - Project name
  - Branch name
  - Agent status (running/compacting/waiting/idle/done)
  - Last activity time

#### Scenario: JSON output
Given worktrees exist
When the user runs `wt-status --json`
Then output is valid JSON with worktree details and summary

#### Scenario: Compact output
Given worktrees exist
When the user runs `wt-status --compact`
Then output is a single line summary suitable for status bars

#### Scenario: Per-agent skill display
- **WHEN** wt-status checks a worktree with agents
- **THEN** each agent's skill is read exclusively from `.wt-tools/agents/<pid>.skill`
- **AND** no fallback to `.wt-tools/current_skill` is used

#### Scenario: Agent with no skill file
- **WHEN** an agent PID has no corresponding `.wt-tools/agents/<pid>.skill` file
- **THEN** the skill field for that agent is null
- **AND** no legacy fallback file is consulted

#### Scenario: Multiple agents with different skills
- **WHEN** two agents on the same worktree have different per-PID skill files
- **THEN** each agent row shows its own skill name independently

### Requirement: Agent Detection
The system SHALL detect all Claude agent processes associated with worktrees using `ps -e` (not `pgrep`, which skips ancestors on macOS). For each detected process, the system SHALL check the parent process (PPID) to determine if the agent is orphaned.

#### Scenario: Detect running agent
Given a Claude process is running in a worktree directory
When wt-status checks that worktree
Then the agents array contains an entry with status "running" and the process PID

#### Scenario: Detect compacting agent
Given a Claude process is summarizing context (compacting)
When wt-status checks that worktree
Then the agents array contains an entry with status "compacting"

#### Scenario: Detect waiting agent
Given a Claude process is sleeping (waiting for input)
When wt-status checks that worktree
Then the agents array contains an entry with status "waiting"

#### Scenario: Detect orphan agent
Given a Claude process exists in a worktree directory
When wt-status checks that worktree
And the process's parent is not a known shell
Then the agents array contains an entry with status "orphan" and the process PID

#### Scenario: No agent
Given no Claude process exists for a worktree
When wt-status checks that worktree
Then the agents array is empty

#### Scenario: Multiple agents detected
Given two or more Claude processes have CWD in a worktree directory
When wt-status checks that worktree
Then the agents array contains one entry per process with independent status, skill, and PID

#### Scenario: CWD path-boundary matching
Given worktrees at /code/foo and /code/foo-bar
When a process has CWD /code/foo-bar
Then it matches only /code/foo-bar, not /code/foo

#### Scenario: Orphan agents excluded from output
- **WHEN** wt-status detects agents in a worktree
- **AND** those agents are "waiting" status
- **AND** no editor window is open for the worktree
- **AND** no Ralph loop is active
- **THEN** the agents are killed and excluded from the agents array

#### Scenario: Editor open status in JSON
- **WHEN** wt-status collects status for a worktree
- **THEN** the JSON entry SHALL include `"editor_open": true|false`
- **AND** the value reflects whether an editor window matching the worktree basename exists

### Requirement: Orphan Agent Detection
The system SHALL detect orphan `claude` processes — those whose parent process is not a known shell (zsh, bash, fish, sh, dash) — and classify them with status `"orphan"` in the `wt-status` JSON output.

#### Scenario: Detect orphan agent
- **WHEN** a `claude` process has CWD in a worktree directory
- **AND** its parent process (PPID) is not a shell (zsh, bash, fish, sh, dash, or their login-shell variants with `-` prefix)
- **THEN** the agent entry in the JSON output SHALL have `"status": "orphan"`

#### Scenario: Normal agent not classified as orphan
- **WHEN** a `claude` process has CWD in a worktree directory
- **AND** its parent process is a known shell (e.g., zsh, -zsh, bash, -bash)
- **THEN** the agent entry SHALL retain its normal status (running, compacting, or waiting)

#### Scenario: Orphan agent in summary counts
- **WHEN** orphan agents exist
- **THEN** they SHALL NOT be counted in the `running`, `compacting`, or `waiting` summary totals

### Requirement: Orphan Agent Display
The GUI SHALL display orphan agents with distinct visual styling to differentiate them from active agents.

#### Scenario: Orphan row background color
- **WHEN** an agent row has `"status": "orphan"`
- **THEN** the row background SHALL use the `row_orphan` color from the active color profile

#### Scenario: Orphan PID warning icon
- **WHEN** an agent row has `"status": "orphan"`
- **THEN** the PID column SHALL display `⚠ <pid>` (warning icon followed by the PID number)

#### Scenario: Orphan status icon
- **WHEN** an agent row has `"status": "orphan"`
- **THEN** the Status column SHALL display `⚠ orphan` with the `status_orphan` color

#### Scenario: Orphan color in all profiles
- **WHEN** any color profile is active (light, dark, gray, high_contrast)
- **THEN** the profile SHALL include `row_orphan`, `row_orphan_text`, and `status_orphan` color values

### Requirement: Kill Orphan Process
The GUI SHALL allow users to terminate orphan agent processes via the row context menu.

#### Scenario: Kill menu item appears for orphan rows
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks on a worktree row
- **AND** the agent for that row has `"status": "orphan"`
- **THEN** the context menu SHALL include a "⚠ Kill Orphan Process" action

#### Scenario: Kill menu item hidden for non-orphan rows
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks on a worktree row
- **AND** the agent for that row does NOT have `"status": "orphan"`
- **THEN** the context menu SHALL NOT include the "⚠ Kill Orphan Process" action

#### Scenario: Kill sends SIGTERM
- **WHEN** the user clicks "⚠ Kill Orphan Process"
- **THEN** the system SHALL send SIGTERM to the orphan process PID
- **AND** the orphan row SHALL disappear on the next status refresh

### Requirement: Editor-Specific Window Focus

Double-click on a worktree row SHALL check for an existing IDE window, regardless of agent status.

- If an IDE window exists for the worktree → focus it
- If no IDE window exists → open it via `wt-work`

The decision SHALL be based solely on window presence, not agent status.

- **AND** the `editor_type` from wt-status matches a known IDE process name (zed, code, cursor, windsurf)
- **THEN** the agent SHALL be displayed with the standard orange `⚡ waiting` icon and colors

#### Scenario: Agent in terminal shows dimmed waiting
- **WHEN** a worktree has an agent with status "waiting"
- **AND** the `editor_type` from wt-status is truthy but does NOT match a known IDE process name
- **THEN** the agent SHALL be displayed with dimmed/muted colors (reusing idle palette)
- **AND** the status text SHALL still read "waiting"

#### Scenario: Running agent always shows green regardless of editor type
- **WHEN** a worktree has an agent with status "running"
- **THEN** the agent SHALL always be displayed with the standard green running indicator
- **AND** the display SHALL NOT be affected by `editor_type`

#### Scenario: No editor_type falls back to standard display
- **WHEN** a worktree has an agent
- **AND** the `editor_type` is null or empty
- **THEN** the standard status display SHALL be used (no dimming)

### Requirement: Focus Action Editor-Type Awareness
The system SHALL optimize the focus action based on the worktree's editor type.

#### Scenario: Focus worktree with IDE editor type
- **WHEN** user triggers focus for a worktree
- **AND** the `editor_type` matches a known IDE process name
- **THEN** the system SHALL first search by window title with the configured app name
- **AND** fall back to `window_id` if title search fails

#### Scenario: Focus worktree with terminal editor type
- **WHEN** user triggers focus for a worktree
- **AND** the `editor_type` is truthy but NOT a known IDE process name
- **AND** a `window_id` is available
- **THEN** the system SHALL skip the title-based IDE search
- **AND** focus the window directly using `window_id`

#### Scenario: Focus worktree with no window
- **WHEN** user triggers focus for a worktree
- **AND** no `window_id` is available
- **AND** no title-based search finds a window
- **THEN** the system SHALL open the worktree in the configured editor
