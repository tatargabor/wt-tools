# developer-memory-docs Specification

## Purpose
Documents the developer memory system across README, docs/developer-memory.md, and GUI, ensuring all CLI commands, features, and integration points are covered.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Developer Memory User Guide
The project SHALL have a `docs/developer-memory.md` file that serves as the comprehensive user-facing guide for the developer memory system.

#### Scenario: Guide file exists
- **WHEN** a user looks for memory documentation

### Requirement: Quick Start Section
The guide SHALL begin with a Quick Start showing the three essential commands: health check, remember, and recall.

#### Scenario: User follows quick start
- **WHEN** a new user reads the Quick Start section
- **THEN** they see `wt-memory health`, a `remember` example with piped content, and a `recall` example with a query

### Requirement: Use Case Examples
The guide SHALL include at least four concrete use case scenarios demonstrating when developer memory is valuable, each with realistic shell commands and expected outputs.

#### Scenario: Negative past experience
- **WHEN** a user reads the "Avoiding repeated mistakes" use case
- **THEN** they see a scenario where an agent saves a failure (Learning type) and a future agent recalls it to avoid the same mistake

#### Scenario: Project decisions
- **WHEN** a user reads the "Project decisions" use case
- **THEN** they see a scenario where a decision is saved (Decision type) and recalled when a related change starts

#### Scenario: Technical gotchas
- **WHEN** a user reads the "Technical gotchas" use case
- **THEN** they see a scenario where a non-obvious behavior is saved (Learning type) during implementation

#### Scenario: Background context
- **WHEN** a user reads the "Background context" use case
- **THEN** they see a scenario where project context is saved (Context type) for onboarding future agents

### Requirement: Memory Types Documentation
The guide SHALL document all three memory types (Decision, Learning, Context) with a comparison table showing when to use each and a concrete example per type.

- **THEN** they see a screenshot showing the Control Center with [M], [O], and [R] status badges in the project header rows

### Requirement: Ambient Memory Documentation
The guide SHALL explain how proactive/ambient memory works outside of OpenSpec — when agents save knowledge during regular conversations.

#### Scenario: Ambient behavior explained
- **WHEN** a user reads the Ambient Memory section
- **THEN** they understand that agents recognize and save knowledge (negative experience, decisions, learnings) during any conversation, not just during OpenSpec workflows

#### Scenario: Fresh project init flow
- **WHEN** a user reads the Quick Setup Flows subsection
- **THEN** they find a numbered sequence for initializing a fresh project with OpenSpec and memory: pip install shodh-memory, wt-project init (deploys hooks+commands+skills), wt-openspec init, wt-memory-hooks install, wt-memory-hooks check

#### Scenario: Add memory to existing project flow
- **WHEN** a user reads the Quick Setup Flows subsection
- **THEN** they find a numbered sequence for adding memory to an existing OpenSpec project: pip install shodh-memory (if needed), wt-project init (re-run to update deployment), wt-memory-hooks install, wt-memory-hooks check
