# Bug register — defects that are not a task in any open change

Every defect **anybody reports — the user, a session, a peer agent — that does not
belong in an open change as a task** is written down here, at the moment it is
reported. Rule stated by the user on 2026-08-19, and the reason is the one that
matters: a session runs out, and a defect that lived only in the conversation
goes with it.

## The line this draws

| where it goes | what it is |
|---|---|
| `tasks.md` of an open change | in scope for that change — it is a task, not a register entry |
| **here** | anything else: found while doing something else, outside the change, or with no change yet |
| a direct commit | a measured defect fix that changes no contract — fix it, then close the entry here |

An entry leaving here becomes either a task in a change or a commit. It does not
become a memory: memory is what is true in every session, and a defect is not.

## Why this exists, measured the day it was written

Three losses on 2026-08-19 alone, all of the same shape:

- A finding from a screen review — *"the agent grid uses the top third and leaves
  the rest black … roughly 60 % of a 1900×1100 viewport is empty"* — was handed to
  another agent, never done, never marked as not done, and resurfaced only because
  that agent volunteered it at handover. The user had also asked for it twice, in
  their own words, and both askings had gone the same way.
- A missing control was reported over the agent channel by a session that then
  closed. Nothing but a chat message held it.
- A comment in `fleetCardStyle.ts` promised a minimum height the code did not
  have. Nobody was wrong on purpose; the claim simply outlived its truth.

## The two conditions that decide whether this rots

1. **Every entry names how it was MEASURED and how you would know it is fixed.**
   Without both, the register becomes a pile nobody can act on, which is the same
   as not having it. "It looks wrong" is a report; a command and its output is an
   entry.
2. **Entries are CLOSED with evidence, never deleted.** A removed entry and one
   that was never written look identical from the outside. Closing means a commit
   sha (or a change name) on the line, and the entry stays.
3. **The number is allocated by MEASURING the file, never by memory.** Measured
   2026-08-19: one session issued `B-9` and `B-10` twice, four commits apart
   (`bf33e28e`, then `a2006254`), so one handle named two different defects and
   *"B-9 is closed"* stopped being an answerable statement. Before writing an
   entry: `grep -oE '^### B-[0-9]+' openspec/bugs/README.md | sort -t- -k2 -n | tail -1`.
   The second pair was renumbered to **B-14** and **B-15**; the first pair keeps
   its numbers because an open change already cites `B-10`
   (`openspec/changes/agent-goal-and-lifecycle/tasks.md:138`).

Also binding here: [External Project Confidentiality](../../CLAUDE.md). A defect
found while looking at a consumer's data is described by its shape, never by the
consumer's name, path, or content.

## Entry format

```markdown

### B-<n> — <one line, the defect, not the symptom>
- **state:** open | closed (`<sha>`) | not-a-defect (why)
- **reported:** <date> by <user | this session | peer agent>, <how>
- **measured:** the command and its output, or a `file:line`

## Open

### B-128 — an open/reveal request that arrives while the file tree is hidden is a silent no-op
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `98f0df93`) — the entry stays; evidence below.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, from `FleetFileView.tsx` read end to end
- **measured:** the only writers of `treeHidden` are the persisted read (`FleetFileView.tsx:397`) and the toggle button (`:862`); nothing un-hides it. The reveal effect (`:762-784`) expands ancestors and `scrollIntoView`s `revealRef` — a button that renders only inside the `{!treeHidden && …}` pane (`:956`) — so with the pane hidden the whole reveal runs against nothing, and `revealFoundNothing` (`:979`), whose entire purpose is to say so, is hidden with it. The panel's own rule, stated at `:709-719`, is that *a control that appears to do nothing is indistinguishable from a broken one*; the hide control breaks it.
- **fail direction:** silent no-op. A ctrl-click on a terminal path lands on a panel that shows nothing happen and says nothing about why.
- **fixed when:** a request carrying an open or reveal target while the tree is hidden makes the target's location visible — either the pane un-hides or the content pane states where the request landed and that the list is hidden — with a unit test driving a request into a hidden-tree panel and asserting the visible outcome.
- **CLOSED by `98f0df93`:** the request effect un-hides the pane before acting, so the reveal's mark lands on a mounted row. The new surface test hides the tree, re-renders with a request for a nested file, and asserts the row renders and the toggle reads `off`; stash-and-rerun confirmed it fails on the unfixed source.

### B-127 — the file view's hidden structure pane is silent and global, so a working panel reads as one broken by file count
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `98f0df93`) — the entry stays; evidence below. The per-project-vs-global decision was taken the same day: the three booleans stay browser-global, written where the keys are defined.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user, with a screenshot of the panel on a consumer project
- **measured:** the screenshot shows the header `20000 of 63389` and the content pane beginning at the panel's left edge + padding — no structure pane, so `treeHidden` was on (`set-file-tree-hidden`, persisted). The listing itself works on that project: `curl 'http://localhost:7400/api/fleet/files?root=<consumer root>'` answered in 4.3 s with `total 38005, truncated True, source git` and **37 top-level entries** for the tree — cheap to render, collapsed by default. The screenshot's `63389` against the measured `38005` also shows `ignored=true` was on, i.e. the persisted `set-file-ignored` flag was on too. Neither persisted flag is per-project: one browser-wide key decides all projects.
- **fail direction:** the hidden state is silent exactly when there is no alarm (a git repository, a status map, no error — `treeAlarm` at `FleetFileView.tsx:735-741` covers only error/no-status), so the panel shows one line of help text over empty space next to a truncation badge. That composition reads as "the panel gave up on a big project", which is what was reported.
- **fixed when:** with the tree hidden, nothing open, and no alarm, the panel states in the content pane that the file list is hidden (and how to bring it back) — never bare empty; and the decision on per-project vs. global persistence of the three booleans is taken and written where the keys are defined.
- **CLOSED by `98f0df93`:** both halves. The content pane renders `the file list is hidden — the panel-list button in the header brings it back.` (`data-fleet-file-list-hidden`) whenever the list is hidden and nothing is open, and the global-flag decision is recorded at the key definitions. Looked at both states on the live dashboard: hidden now reads as a hidden state, not a broken panel; bringing it back restores the pane and its splitter.

### B-126 — the rename route's `carried` answer grew `agent_order` and its test still asserts the old exact dict
- **state:** OPEN — found while implementing `fleet-agent-stage-tree`, and NOT caused by it: fails identically with the change's edits to `api/fleet.py` stashed.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, via `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py -q`
- **measured:** `tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py::test_a_rename_carries_the_record_and_the_layout` fails at HEAD (`e02133ff`): `assert answer["carried"] == {"record": 1, "docked": 1, "splits": 1}` gets `{'record': 1, 'docked': 1, 'splits': 1, 'agent_order': 0}` — the route began reporting that it also carried the per-project agent order, and the exact-equality assertion was not updated.
- **fail direction:** test-stricter-than-product. The product's extra key is information, not breakage; the stale assertion makes the suite red on a correct route, which trains whoever runs it to ignore that file's failures.
- **what would prove it fixed:** that test passing on a tree where the only difference from HEAD is the test (or route) edit, with the full `test_fleet_api.py` green around it.
- **note:** it is a pre-existing failure of the kind the `regression-baseline` skill exists to set-diff against — it must not be counted against any current change.

### B-125 — `set-web` could not start at all, and nothing noticed for four hours because the running process predated the break
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, this session) — the entry stays; measurement and fix below.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, on the first restart of the service in four hours
- **measured:** `journalctl --user -u set-web` — `NameError: name 'Dict' is not defined` at `lib/set_orch/usage/accounts.py:162`, raised at import time through `api/__init__.py` -> `api/usage.py` -> `usage/accounts.py`. The file used `Dict[...]` and `Any` while importing only `List` (line 16). Introduced by `338837ed`; the running process had `ExecMainStartTimestamp = 17:01:35`, which is BEFORE that commit, so it held the last importable version of the module and served requests normally the whole time. Port 7400 stopped listening the moment it was restarted.
- **fail direction:** the worst available. A totally broken service looked completely healthy — `systemctl is-active` said `active`, the dashboard answered every request — because liveness was a property of a process started from older code. The break is invisible until the next restart, which may be days away and will look like it was caused by whatever was deployed then.
- **why it is worth an entry despite the one-line fix:** it is the literal case of this project's own rule that *a shipped commit is not a running system*, and it was found only as a side effect of needing a restart for something else. Nothing routinely restarts this service and nothing imports the module in CI, so the same shape can recur in any module reached only through the API's import chain.
- **CLOSED by:** `from typing import Any, Dict, List` at `accounts.py:16`, verified by importing the module directly and by the service reaching `active` with port 7400 listening again.
- **residual risk, stated rather than fixed:** an import-time break anywhere under `lib/set_orch/api/**` still has no check that would catch it before a restart. A smoke import of `set_orch.server` would.


### B-124 — `stageOrder` was AGREED with a consumer and rendering an undeclared value visibly is OWED, but nothing is implemented, so an undeclared lane is silently dropped
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `declared-stage-order`) — the entry stays; the closing evidence is at the end.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, after a consumer designed against the promise and said so on the channel
- **measured:** one grep over the whole repository with `.git` excluded — `stageOrder` / `stage_order`, case-insensitive — matches **exactly one file**, `docs/integration/consumer-integration.md`. No code, no test, no spec delta, no OpenSpec change. The behaviour promised in exchange (condition 2: "the framework renders any value absent from the order **visibly and distinctly**, never silently sorted to the end and never dropped") is contradicted by what ships: `lib/set_orch/project_status.py:679` falls through with the comment "Unknown, or a paired form without a usable partner name. Inert by design.", and `web/src/components/statusShape.tsx:857-865` returns `null` for any unrecognised string. Both re-read today rather than recalled.
- **fail direction:** silent drop, in the reassuring direction, and it has already left the building. The living record itself warned of exactly this at the moment of the agreement — *"it must be ADDED, not merely tolerated. An unknown role is silently ignored today ... so `stageOrder` would be inert on both sides. Inert is not acceptance."* — and the warning was recorded rather than acted on the same day.
- **why it outranks its size:** the consumer restructured their own model around the promise. Their plan had `unknown` as a terminal station; on the strength of condition 2 they rewrote it as *the absence of a signal* and explicitly declined to invent a private sentinel. Their adversarial review then found Hungarian band keys against the English `stageOrder`, and scored the consequence as "every card lands in set-core's not-in-the-declared-order rendering". The true consequence today is "every card silently disappears". A promise held only on a channel shaped somebody else's design and inverted the fail direction of their own review finding.
- **fixed when:** a value absent from a declared `stageOrder` renders visibly and distinctly — never dropped, never sorted last — on both the Python and the renderer path, with a test per side feeding an undeclared lane and asserting it is present AND marked; and `stageOrder` itself is honoured as a static declaration (F1: an empty stage still appears; two queries over different card sets return the same order). Contract change, so it carries a spec delta rather than a direct commit.
- **CLOSED by the change `declared-stage-order`**, both halves, and the evidence is a LOOK rather than a suite. Layer 1 (`3e76932a`) parses the array form and resolves it statically; the renderer (`web/src/lib/stageGroups.ts`, `StatusTable`, `statusShape`) orders the rows and draws a strip stating every declared stage. Proved by stash-and-rerun at both layers — 10 Python tests and 14 web tests fail on their assertions against reverted code and pass restored, sha256-verified both ways. The FIRST stash-and-rerun proved nothing and is recorded in the commit: it produced a collection error, not failures, because the new symbols do not exist at HEAD.
- **looked at, in a browser, against a live producer.** A throwaway fixture declaring the six-stage order through the real contract path rendered: `lane: planned 30 | specified 0 | in-progress 4 | implemented 0 | demoed 0 | done 1 | tesztelés 1 ⚑ | (no value) 1 ⚑ — 2 rows outside the declared order`. Three guarantees visible at once: three declared stages present holding zero; two undeclared values present and marked; and **`done 1` while that row is NOT in the visible 25-row slice** — the count coming from the full set rather than the rendered one, which is the trap that would have turned an honest cap into a false absence. Fixture removed afterwards; nothing of it persists.
- **note:** told to the consumer on the channel the same evening, before their `tasks.md` was written, with the instruction to treat their flat-array fallback as the load-bearing path and `stageOrder` as a later enhancement.


### B-122 — a messaging-sourced project is named by whichever seat enrolled FIRST against its root, so a project can vanish behind another project's name
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user — "I cant see set-agent-comm in the fleet project view"
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/fleet/discovery.py:566` — `found.setdefault(root, {"root": root, "name": str(name), ...})` groups the messaging registry by ROOT and keeps the FIRST name the map yields; JSON preserves insertion order, so it is enrolment order. Measured on the live registry: two seats share `~/code2/set-agent-comm` under two different agent names, and the earlier one wins. `/api/fleet/agents` then returned **two rows carrying the same name** with different roots, and no row under the directory's own name. The `os.path.basename(root)` fallback already present on the same line is never reached, because the wrong name is not empty — it is merely wrong. Upstream, the messaging tool derives the agent name from the shell's cwd — **corrected 2026-08-29 by that project's own maintainer session: this is DELIBERATE, and `SET_AGENT_NAME` is the documented override for exactly the case where two agents share a root** (confirmed here by reading that tree's `.claude/settings.json`, whose hooks set it explicitly). So the upstream half is a configuration gap, not a defect; the downstream half — an inventory losing a project because two names share one root — is ours and stands. Noted because the first version of this line reported someone else's deliberate design as their bug.
- **fail direction:** silent and doubly wrong — a project the estate holds is absent (false absence at whole-project level) while another project's name is duplicated on a row that is not it (false value). Neither is marked, and the row count does not change.
- **workaround applied 2026-08-29:** registering the project made the registry source supply the name, which wins because `discover_projects` merges the registry first (`discovery.py:586-597`). Verified: the row is now `set-agent-comm | sources=['registry','messaging']` and the duplicate is gone. This fixes one instance, not the class.
- **measured 2026-08-29, a fix that does NOT apply:** `sac prune --days 30 --dry-run` forgets 5 stale SEATS and keeps 106; none of them is the colliding agent-level record, because prune operates on seats and the collision is between two agent names. The obvious cleanup does not reach this.
- **fixed when:** a messaging entry whose root already carries a different name either renders under the directory basename or renders as its own marked row, and a unit test feeds two seat names against one root and asserts no two rows in the result share a name.

### B-123 — `set-project init --dry-run` under-reports its own blast radius: four write paths appear only in the real run
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, while running the deploy the register rule requires be previewed first
- **measured:** the dry-run plan on a real tree listed commands, skills, rules, agents and one generated-patterns file. The subsequent real run additionally reported `Added Persistent Memory section to CLAUDE.md`, `Added Auto-Commit After Apply section to CLAUDE.md`, `Added Getting Started reference to CLAUDE.md`, `Scaffolded set/ directory structure` and `Registered set-core MCP server` — plus a modified `.gitignore` and a new `.env.example`, neither named in the plan. Net effect measured by sha256 snapshot of `.claude/` and `set/` before and after: **24 files -> 72**, and exactly one pre-existing file rewritten (`.claude/settings.json`, merged additively — the tree's own hook wiring survived).
- **fail direction:** toward under-statement, which is the direction that matters. The project rule says to preview because the plan "is honest about its own blast radius"; a reader who approves on the plan approves less than what runs. The rewritten file happened to be merged correctly — that is a property of this run, not something the plan promised.
- **note:** `.claude/` is gitignored in the tree this was measured on, so `git status` showed none of the 48 new files. The prescribed post-run diff-check is structurally blind wherever a tree ignores `.claude/`; a hash snapshot is the check that works.
- **fixed when:** the dry-run enumerates every path the real run writes — the CLAUDE.md sections, the `set/` scaffold, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` and the MCP registration — and a test asserts the planned path set equals the set the real run touches.


### B-116 — an ALIAS variable the chosen provider does not declare survives into the child's environment
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `e886a39f`) — the entry stays; measurement and fix below.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/providers/resolver.py:81-85` — `FOREIGN_KEYS` (what `unset` carries) names only `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, never the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` keys. `resolve()` emits only the aliases the chosen provider declares (`resolver.py:322-323`), so a shell export like `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6` survives both start paths: `bin/set-glm:133-136` builds the child env from `os.environ` minus `plan.unset` only, and `lib/set_orch/fleet/ownerd.py:666` merges a caller-supplied mapping under `plan.env` — a caller key the plan does not overwrite passes through. The `opus`-declaring subagent then sends an Anthropic id at the GLM endpoint — B-115's exact symptom, through a path B-115's fix does not close. The outranking test (`tests/unit/test_fleet_owner_provider.py:327`) covers `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` but no alias key.
- **CLOSED by** (`e886a39f`): `plan.unset` now carries every alias variable the plan did not emit and the provider did not hand-write in its own `env`. Anchored by two unit tests (non-declared keys are unset; an emitted key is delivered AND not unset), and by `tests/live/probe_subagent_model.py` — the anthropic live probe shows all four ambient GLM alias keys in `unset` and only Claude-family models served.

### B-117 — `launch_args()` drops the whole declared-args block when ANY ONE flag collides
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/providers/resolver.py:166-170` — `if not (declared_flags & caller): add += list(self.args)` is all-or-nothing. A provider declaring `["--autocompact", "700k", "--verbose"]` whose caller passed `--verbose` gets the empty intersection test fail, so `--autocompact 700k` — never passed by the caller — is silently dropped. Latent only because the current config declares one flag; the second declared flag re-arms it. Same fail direction as B-114: nothing errors, the record stays honest, the effect is missing.
- **fixed when:** a per-flag skip (flag and its value token) replaces the block skip, and a test with two declared flags where the caller passed one asserts the other still arrives.

### B-118 — `launch_args()` translates the model through an ANTHROPIC short-name map for EVERY provider, and the anchor test that should catch drift can silently skip
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `ab18cf5c`) — the entry stays; the decision and the measurement are below.
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/providers/resolver.py:164-172` called `resolve_model_id` unconditionally; the map (`lib/set_orch/subprocess_utils.py:154-169`) maps `sonnet` → `claude-sonnet-4-6` etc. A non-Anthropic provider whose catalogue legitimately contains a key of that map gets the translated ANTHROPIC id sent to its own endpoint — a wrong value delivered silently, the outcome the method's own docstring calls worse than none. The anchor test meant to catch catalogue/map drift (`tests/unit/test_providers_resolver.py:451-454`) guarded with `if declared is not None:` after `config.load()` of the LIVE machine file — no `anthropic` provider on the machine and the assertion is a no-op; a 0600 or absent config and the test errors.
- **THE fable DECISION, measured (2026-08-29):** the CLI resolves `fable` NATIVELY — stripped environment, unreachable endpoint, `--model fable` produced ZERO `unrecognized_model` lines and attempted the call, while `--model sonnet-1m` under identical conditions was refused under its own name immediately. Pass-through of `fable` is therefore CORRECT and the old anchor's premise was wrong. First probe attempt was contaminated (the ambient `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` leaked into the probe shell and the CLI resolved fable through it — the measurement was inside the corpus it measured); the clean-environment rerun is the measurement. `fable` joined the framework's own catalogue (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL_NAMES`, the derived regex literal, the test fixture), deliberately NOT `_MODEL_MAP`.
- **CLOSED by** (`ab18cf5c`): the translation is gated on `MODEL_MAP_PROVIDERS` (`{anthropic}` — explicit data; a provider whose catalogue holds short names adds itself deliberately), and the anchor is hermetic — fixture catalogue plus a named `cli_native` set carrying the measurement, never `config.load()`. Verified by full-suite set-diff against a HEAD baseline: failure sets byte-identical except the anchor itself, red on HEAD and green here.
- **measured again 2026-08-29, same day:** the anchor went RED on this machine — `config.load()` returned the live config whose anthropic catalogue now contains `fable`, which `_MODEL_MAP` does not know (`tests/unit/test_providers_resolver.py::test_the_model_is_translated_to_a_cli_id_on_the_way_out`). Confirmed pre-existing by pathspec stash-and-rerun on HEAD. The hermeticity half of this entry is thereby demonstrated live; the drift half needs a decision first — pass-through of `fable` is arguably CORRECT (the CLI resolves the alias natively), so the anchor's premise "every catalogue short name must be in the map" may itself be the wrong assertion, not the map.

### B-119 — once aliases exist, the record's provenance is a false value and names the wrong model for a subagent
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/providers/resolver.py:332` sets `provenance["env"] = LEVEL_DEFAULT`, but the env now carries provider-declared alias targets the machine default never named — `LEVEL_PROVIDER`'s own comment (`resolver.py:70-75`) calls exactly this a false value. And the record (`lib/set_orch/fleet/ownerd.py:692-694`) names `model=plan.model` with nothing about the alias map: a sonnet-declared subagent under a plan recorded `glm-5.3-flash` is answered per-alias, and every reader attributes cost and quality to a model that did not reply. The honest state is a documented absence; today it is undocumented.
- **fixed when:** `describe()` and the provider record name the alias targets (or the resolved alias map), and `provenance["env"]` reflects the level that supplied the alias values.

### B-120 — `set-glm --model=X` and a trailing `set-glm --model` both mangle the launch argv
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `bin/set-glm:110-113` detects only the exact token `--model` followed by a value. `--model=glm-4.6` leaves `requested_model=None`, so the resolver picks the default and `launch_args()` (whose collision check is also exact-match, `resolver.py:171`) appends a second `--model` — two on one argv, resolution order-dependent. `--model` as the LAST token leaves a valueless flag in `passthrough` with `requested_model` still `None`.
- **fixed when:** both sites also match the `--model=` prefix; a valueless trailing `--model` dies with a message naming the problem, in the file's refusal style.

### B-121 — two refusal/skip branches around `--model` and `model_aliases` ship unexercised
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by code-reviewer subagent; verified same day by reading the code
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/providers/resolver.py:171` — if a provider's DECLARED `args` contained `--model`, `"--model" not in add` holds and `plan.model` is never appended: the declared value would win with no provenance and no test covers the branch. And `lib/set_orch/providers/config.py:295-298` refuses a non-dict `model_aliases`, but no test in `tests/unit/test_providers_config.py` feeds one (e.g. a list) through.
- **fixed when:** a test where declared args carry `--model` states which value must win; a non-dict `model_aliases` refusal is message-content-tested.

### B-115 — a subagent under a provider-switched parent keeps the parent's ENDPOINT and its own ANTHROPIC model name, and the gateway answers anyway
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `efd2c0f1`) — the entry stays; the measurement and the decision are below. Raised by the user's question ("subagents will also work?") while closing B-114.
- **measured 2026-08-29, two probes against the live GLM endpoint:**

  | probe | model sent | result |
  |---|---|---|
  | A | `glm-5.3-flash` (the provider's own) | `stop_reason: end_turn` — works |
  | B | `claude-sonnet-4-6` (an ANTHROPIC id) | `stop_reason: end_turn` — **also works** |

  The gateway does not refuse a model name from another vendor. It answers, bills the GLM
  account, and nothing in the result says which model actually replied.
- **how the inheritance happens, both kinds:**
  - Claude Code's own Task subagents run in the parent's process, so they hold its
    `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` — the endpoint is inherited.
  - The framework's spawned agents are separate processes, and
    `subprocess_utils.run_command` builds `full_env = {**os.environ, **env}` — so they inherit
    it too, while being launched with `--model resolve_model_id(<role model>)`.
  - Three agent definitions pin an Anthropic name outright: `code-reviewer: sonnet`,
    `gui-tester: haiku`, `openspec-verifier: sonnet`. `model_config.py`'s role presets do the
    same for orchestration roles.
- **⚠ the validation is inverted, which is why this is invisible.** Probe A — the CORRECT
  model for the endpoint — produced `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]`, because Claude Code
  checks the name against its OWN catalogue. Probe B — the wrong-vendor model — produced no
  warning at all. So the one diagnostic that exists fires on the right answer and stays silent
  on the wrong one.
- **the direction it fails in:** silently, and in the direction that makes a quality change
  invisible. A reviewer subagent "on sonnet" under a GLM parent is answered by some GLM model;
  the transcript, the record and the screen all still say sonnet. This is the same false-value
  shape as B-114, one level down — and B-114's fix does not touch it, because the resolver
  deliberately scopes out "choosing the model for an orchestration ROLE"
  (`openspec/specs/agent-provider-start/spec.md`, Out of scope).
- **what would prove it fixed:** a role or agent-definition model is resolved AGAINST the
  provider the parent runs on — either mapped to that provider's catalogue, or refused by name
  the way `resolve()` refuses an unknown model. A cross-vendor pair must not reach the
  gateway; the design's own rule is that a level supplying a credential supplies its endpoint,
  and no launch silently falls back to another frame.
- **CLOSED by a validated `model_aliases` block** (`efd2c0f1`), declared per provider and
  checked at load time against that provider's own catalogue. Each entry becomes one
  `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_<ALIAS>_MODEL` variable, which is the only carrier that reaches a Task
  subagent: it chooses inside the running CLI, after launch, so no argv can reach it.
  **Proven, not assumed** — pointing the sonnet alias at a name that does not exist produced
  `unrecognized_model {"model": "<that name>"}` with `duration_api_ms: 0`, so the alias was
  rewritten and no call was made. Verified cross-project: an agent started on glm in a
  DIFFERENT project received all four variables plus `--model` and the endpoint.

  The validation is the point of a block rather than raw variables: setting them by hand
  accepts any string, and the only symptom of a typo is one subagent quietly answering from a
  fallback.

- **The model choice, decided 2026-08-29 from measurement rather than instinct — and it
  REVERSED the first answer.** The map was initially set to `glm-5.3` for every alias, on the
  user's rule that a weak model must not be used. Researching the two models changed it:

  | | DeepSWE v1.1 | modality | Coding Plan quota |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | GLM-5.2 (previous flagship) | 46.2 | — | — |
  | GLM-5.3-Flash | 63.4 | **multimodal** (video/image/file) | **3x** |
  | GLM-5.3 | 66.9 | **text only** | 1x |

  **CORRECTED the same hour, by the user and then by measurement: EVERYTHING is on
  `glm-5.3-flash`, main agent included.** The split above put the main agent on `glm-5.3`,
  reasoning that its work is text — which ignored that the user reports defects BY PASTING
  SCREENSHOTS, twice in this session alone, and each time the screenshot WAS the bug report.
  A blind primary agent breaks the actual workflow, not a subagent's.

  ⚠ **And `glm-5.3` does not refuse an image — it answers wrongly.** Measured against the
  live endpoint with solid-colour PNGs:

  | truth | glm-5.3 | glm-5.3-flash |
  |---|---|---|
  | green | "Green" | "Green" |
  | magenta | **"Teal"** | "Magenta" |
  | orange | **no answer** | "Orange" |

  It returns HTTP 200 and a confident answer. **The first probe used green and both models
  said "Green" — a guessable value produced a false pass**, and stopping there would have
  shipped a blind main agent with a measurement that appeared to prove the opposite. The
  colour had to be one no guesser would reach before the test measured anything at all.

  So the quota argument for Flash stands, the quality gap (~5% on DeepSWE) is accepted
  deliberately, and vision decides the rest: Flash is the only one of the two that can SEE. Putting `gui-tester` on text-only
  `glm-5.3` would have broken the repo's own rule that a UI change is not done until somebody
  looked at the screen. Flash is also not the "weak model" the original rule guarded against:
  it beats the previous flagship by 17 points.

  ⚠ **The friend-reported claim was half right and the wording mattered.** It was reported as
  a *concurrency* limit that is smaller for `glm-5.3`. z.ai publishes **no per-model
  concurrency limit** — concurrency is dynamic, ranked Max > Pro > Lite, and raised off-peak.
  What is documented is a **quota** difference (3x, plus 50% points off-peak). The practical
  effect is the same but the two fail differently: a quota limit throttles the day, a
  concurrency cap throttles one fan-out.

- **The two levers are separate and both now point at Flash:** `default_model` governs the
  PRIMARY agent, `model_aliases` governs SUBAGENTS. Not measured: the account's plan tier
  (Lite ~80 / Pro ~400 / Max ~1600 prompts per 5 h), which decides how much the 3x is worth.

### B-114 — the resolved MODEL reaches the record, the API and the tile, and never the child's command line
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29) — the entry stays; the measurement is below
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user, from the fleet screen: an agent whose tile read `glm`
  answered *"Yes — I'm Opus 5 (1M context)"*. The user's question was the whole diagnosis:
  *"are you still opus? i wanted to create a glm"*.
- **measured:** on the live agent `set-core-1624`, the owner reported
  `provider glm, model glm-5.3-flash` while its real command line held no model at all:

  ```
  /proc/3128646/cmdline -> claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --autocompact 700k
  ```

  `resolve()` computes `plan.model` and returns it; `LaunchPlan.args` carried only the
  PROVIDER's declared args. So the credential and the endpoint were delivered — the agent
  really did bill against z.ai — and the model was not, leaving the CLI's own default.
- **where the rule lived:** in exactly one caller, `bin/set-glm:148`
  (`if "--model" not in args: args += ["--model", plan.model]`). The owner's start path and
  its recover path never had it. One rule, three call sites, two of them written without it.
- **⚠ the test asserted the defect.** `tests/unit/test_fleet_owner_provider.py:295` asserted
  the delivered argv by EQUALITY —
  `["claude", "--dangerously-skip-permissions", "--setting", "x"]` — three lines above
  asserting `payload["model"] == "glm-4.6"`. The two together state "the model is recorded and
  is not on the command line" as correct behaviour. **No mutation and no green run could ever
  have reported this**, because the expected value was the bug. This is the sharper half of the
  finding: the change archived with 58/58 acceptance criteria, and the criteria checked what
  was RECORDED.
- **the direction it fails in:** silently, toward spending on the wrong frame. Nothing errors,
  the endpoint answers, the record is honest about what was ASKED for, and the only symptom is
  a model nobody chose answering under the name of one somebody did — visible solely by asking
  the agent, or by reading `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
- **fixed when / CLOSED by:** `LaunchPlan.launch_args(caller_args)` returns the declared args
  AND the resolved model, skipping any flag the caller already passed, and all three call sites
  use it. A plan that hands out its own arguments cannot be under-delivered by the next caller
  written. Held by four tests on the plan and by the two argv assertions above, corrected to
  the delivered value — those two are the regression anchors, since they are the ones that were
  wrong.

### B-113 — the pre-fork survival guard refuses EVERY start on a provider that carries a credential, because it reads `unset` as "absent from the child"
- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29) — the entry stays; the measurement is below
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user, from the fleet screen, with a screenshot: a start
  named `set-core-glmtest` on `glm` / `glm-5.3-flash` returned
  *"did not start: the resolved environment did not survive into the child:
  ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (should have been removed), ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL (should have been
  removed)"*.
- **measured:** `assert_env_survived()` held two rules that contradict each other for any
  provider needing a credential. `LaunchPlan` and `build_child_env` define `unset` as
  *removed FIRST, then `env` applied on top*; the guard instead required every `unset` key to
  be ABSENT from the child. `resolver.FOREIGN_KEYS` strips `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` unconditionally, and the glm plan supplies two
  of those three — so the overlap is not an edge case, it is every credentialled provider.
  Reproduced deterministically before the fix:

  ```
  keys in BOTH unset and env: ['ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN', 'ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL']
  guard: REFUSED -> ... ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (should have been removed), ...
  ```

- **why 49 caught mutations and a full green suite could not see it:** the fixture in
  `tests/unit/test_fleet_owner_provider.py` uses `unset=("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",)`, which does
  not overlap its own `env`. The real constant necessarily does. **A fixture that avoids the
  overlap cannot fail on it** — the tests exercised the mechanism and were silent about the
  case, and no mutation could reach a branch the fixture never entered.
- **the direction it fails in:** loudly and totally, which is the only reason it was cheap.
  A refusal naming its reason reached the person who acted, and nothing started on the wrong
  account. The same contradiction resolved the other way — treating a leftover as acceptable —
  would have been the silent-spend defect B-110 (provider) exists for.
- **fixed when / CLOSED by:** the removal check excludes keys `resolved` re-supplies. Coverage
  is not lost by narrowing, which is the argument that makes it safe to weaken a guard at all:
  a key in `resolved` is still checked by the first rule and **more strictly** — its exact
  value rather than its mere absence. Held by two tests, both of which fail against the old
  line: one on the contradiction itself (and asserting that a NON-re-supplied leftover, and a
  re-supplied key carrying the ambient value, are both still refused), one anchored on the real
  `FOREIGN_KEYS` so the fixture cannot drift away from the constant again.

### B-112 — a change carries no record of its own verification, so verified and never-verified are indistinguishable once the run is gone
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by a consumer project's session over the runtime channel — not as a set-core bug, but as the reason they dropped a `verified` stage from their release board: verification "leaves no artifact today, so it is not measurable", and the label would lie in the reassuring direction. Verified here before entering, and the true statement is narrower and worse than the one relayed.
- **measured:**
  - **Interactive `/opsx:verify` writes nothing at all.** `.claude/commands/opsx/verify.md` and `.claude/skills/openspec-verify-change/SKILL.md` are the same 8-step procedure and are read-only by construction — frontmatter `allowed-tools: Bash(openspec:*)` (`verify.md:4`). Step 8 is titled "Generate Verification Report" but every output it specifies is chat text (`verify.md:164-171`). The two sentinels in `templates/core/rules/spec-verify-gate.md:31-34` (`CRITICAL_COUNT:`, `VERIFY_RESULT:`) are explicitly "the final TWO lines" of that chat report. The only file that rule names, `<change-dir>/verify-hook.sh:108`, is an INPUT the author commits; only its exit code is read.
  - **The OpenSpec CLI has no verify command** (v1.9.0) and `openspec archive` neither requires nor records a verification. `openspec status --change <name> --json` returns `isComplete`, which means "planning artifacts exist", not "verified".
  - **Nothing under `openspec/changes/*/`, active or archived.** Sampled across the 443 archived changes: `proposal.md` / `design.md` / `tasks.md` / `specs/**` and nothing else. Grep for `VERIFY_RESULT` and `"verified"` over `openspec/` hits only prose ABOUT the gate, never a record of a run.
  - **The orchestrated gate DOES persist — but run-scoped, never change-scoped.** Three side effects, all of which die with the run: a session-keyed sidecar `~/.claude/projects/-<mangled-cwd>/<session_id>.verdict.json` (`gate_verdict.py:74,182,228`, schema at `:140-165`); the `spec_verify_result` / `gate_spec_verify_ms` / `spec_verify_output` fields in `orchestration-state.json` and `journals/<change>.jsonl` (`gate_runner.py:814-820,847-859`); and an `LLM_CALL` event tagged `[PURPOSE:spec_verify:<change>]` in the run's `*-events.jsonl` (`subprocess_utils.py:398-460`). None propagates into the change directory, so archiving discards the outcome.
- **fixed when:** a reader with only `openspec/changes/<name>/` (or its archived copy) can tell verified from never-verified — and, because a stale pass is worse than no record, the record names WHAT was verified (the artifact hashes or a commit sha) so a later edit invalidates it rather than inheriting the verdict. Both paths must write it: the interactive `/opsx:verify` currently cannot, since its `allowed-tools` forbids writing.
- **why it is worth more than its size:** it was found from the outside. A consumer removed a column from their own data model to avoid asserting something this framework cannot substantiate — the gap left the repo and shaped somebody else's design before anybody here noticed it. And the fail direction is the one this project keeps paying for: a change with no verification record looks exactly like a verified one, and the reassuring reading is the default.
- **note:** `/opsx:verify`'s generated skill and command are REWRITTEN by `openspec update` (see `.claude/rules/openspec-artifacts.md`), so a fix must not live in those files.

### B-111 — a question addressed to a person is written onto the blank line above the task, so the surface reports that nothing is pending

- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `92313420`) — the entry stays; the measurement is below
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, from the third real work unit driven from the
  fleet screen (`work-cycle-run-visibility` task 7.4). Not a task in that change: the defect
  is in the engine's connector, not in the screen.
- **measured:** the unit did exactly what it was asked to. Its record says:

  ```
  verdict: NEEDS_INPUT
  open_decisions: [{task: "3.1", question: "What exactly should the third line say?"}]
  set_aside: {kind: "human-decision", detail: "<the question>"}
  gate: null   commit: null
  ```

  And the engine's own `status`, one second later, in the same tree:

  ```
  answers: no answers were pending
  3: runnable — selected
  ```

  The two disagree, and the one a person reads is the reassuring one. `git diff` on the task
  file shows why — the question landed on the **blank line above** the task:

  ```
  -
  + <!-- awaiting: What exactly should the third line ... -->
    - [ ] 3.1 Append a third line to docs/work-cycle-proof/NOTE.md ...
  ```

- **cause, isolated to one character:** `_task_line_re` built its indent group as
  `^(?P<indent>\s*)` under `re.M`. `\s` matches a newline, so the engine anchors `^` at the
  BLANK line, lets `\s*` consume the newline, and matches the task on the *next* line — a
  match whose `start()` is on the blank line. Every caller derives the line to rewrite from
  `match.start()`. Measured in isolation:

  ```
  3.1 (first task of a group) → the resolved line is ''
  3.2 (mid-list)              → the resolved line is '- [ ] 3.2 second task'
  ```

  So it fires on the **first task of every group** and nowhere else — because only there is a
  blank line reachable from a preceding `^`. That is also exactly where a decision reserved
  for a person tends to sit.
- **why every test passed:** the fixture in `tests/unit/test_workcycle_connector.py` has
  contained a `3.1` from the start, and **every existing test asked about `3.2`**. The case
  was present and never exercised.
- **fail direction — the expensive one:** `mark_awaiting` returned **True**. The question is
  physically in the file, attached to nothing; `awaiting_tasks()` finds no marker; `status`
  says nothing is pending; the group is offered as runnable. Press start again and a second
  unit asks the same question in different words. This is the engine's own
  `answer released but never delivered` finding, one layer along.
- **fixed (`92313420`):** the indent group is `[ \t]*`, and `mark_awaiting` now refuses
  to write at all when the line it resolved is not a task line — a write that produces no
  marker must not report success. Mutation-tested: restoring `\s*` fails the new test, and
  the refusal guard fires independently; restore verified byte-identical by sha256. 85 tests
  green in the two affected files.
- **numbered B-110 first, and that number was taken** by a parallel session while this was
  being written — the second time today. Measuring the highest number once per session is
  not enough when two sessions write the same file.

### B-110 — the dashboard watcher recursively watches every project ROOT, so 45 projects cost 176 687 inotify watches and a quarter of a core at idle
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user, from an htop screenshot showing `cli_entry.py serve --port 7400` at the top of the CPU list
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/watcher.py:181-183` adds `self.project_path` (the project ROOT) to `watch_dirs`, and `watchfiles.awatch` is recursive by default, so the whole tree is watched — `node_modules`, `.git`, `.next`, `.venv` included. On this machine, one `set-web` process at idle:
  - `45` inotify instances, **`176 687` watches total** (sum of `^inotify wd:` lines across `/proc/<pid>/fdinfo/*`) — 34 % of `fs.inotify.max_user_watches` (524 288) held by a single process
  - **22–26 % of one core** steady state, with no orchestration running — three consecutive 10 s samples of `/proc/<pid>/stat` fields 14+15 gave `252`, `220`, `264` ticks, i.e. 2.2–2.6 s of CPU per 10 s of wall clock
  - `45` `notify-rs inotify` threads — exactly one per entry in `projects.json` (45 projects)
  - the per-instance counts match the trees one-to-one: `find <root> -type d | wc -l` gives `11 373` for this repo against `11 374` watches on its fd, and `33 756` for the largest registered project against `34 440`
  - the churn is visible in the log: `watchfiles.main: all changes filtered out` on `.git/index.lock` files inside worktrees of E2E runs that finished in April
  - the cost is not only CPU: a trivial `GET /api/projects` takes `0.73 s` while the event loop is saturated
  - **18 of the 45 registered projects are finished E2E runs** (38 GB under the runs directory), so most of the watch budget is spent on trees nothing will ever write to again
- **fixed when:** with the same 45 projects registered, `set-web` at idle holds **under 5 000** inotify watches total and burns **under 2 % of one core** (20 ticks / 10 s), while a state-file change in a live project still reaches a connected WebSocket client. Two independent parts: (a) stop watching the project root recursively — watch the state/log directories, and give the root a non-recursive watch or a `watch_filter` that excludes `node_modules`, `.git`, `.next`, `.venv`, `dist`, `build`; (b) do not start a watcher for a project whose orchestration is finished.
- **note on the fail direction:** it fails toward *silence*, which is why it survived. Nothing errors, the dashboard answers 200, and the only symptom is a machine that feels slow — so the cost is charged to every other process on the box rather than to the feature that incurs it.

### B-110 — a start names GLM and the agent comes up on the machine default, because the owner service silently ignores a parameter it does not know

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by the user, from the fleet screen, with a screenshot: an agent
  started as `set-core-kanban` after choosing a provider answered *"Opus 5 (1M context) —
  model ID: claude-opus-5[1m] · Claude Max"*, and its tile read `provider unrecorded`.
- **measured:** the owner service (`set-agent-owner.service`) has been running since
  **2026-08-28 15:54:42** (`systemctl --user show -p ExecMainStartTimestamp`); the resolver
  reached `lib/set_orch/fleet/ownerd.py` in commit `686ac381` at **2026-08-29 14:11**. The
  running daemon therefore holds the pre-change `_do_start`, which reads only `label`,
  `cwd`, `argv`, `env`, `rows`, `cols` and `requested_by`:

  ```
  git show 830df00b:lib/set_orch/fleet/ownerd.py   # the shipped-then version
  → argv = list(params.get("argv") or DEFAULT_AGENT_ARGV)
  ```

  `provider` and `model` arrive in `params` and are **dropped without a word**. The start
  succeeds, the agent runs on whatever the ambient environment supplies, and no record is
  written — so the screen honestly reports `provider unrecorded` for an agent the user
  explicitly gave a provider.

- **the direction it fails in, and why this is a design defect and not just a stale
  process:** silently, in the direction that spends money on the wrong account. A caller
  that names a provider and is ignored gets a 200, a running agent, and a tile that looks
  ordinary. This is the same shape as the HTTP start body, which accepted an unknown field
  and dropped it until `extra="forbid"` was added the same day — **the socket layer was
  left with the identical hole.** Restarting the daemon fixes today's symptom and leaves
  the defect: any future owner older than its caller will do this again.

- **what would prove it fixed:** a start naming a provider against an owner that cannot
  resolve one is REFUSED, naming the reason, and no agent is created. Held by a test that
  drives the client against a health answer with no provider capability. Restarting the
  service is the operational half and is not the fix.

- **cost of the operational half, so it is a decision and not a reflex — CORRECTED
  2026-08-29, and the first version was wrong in the direction that makes the act look
  cheap.** This entry originally said restarting the owner "does not kill the agents — they
  run in sibling scopes — but every one of them loses its browser terminal and becomes an
  orphan". The sibling-scope half is true and the conclusion does not follow. The unit file
  says so in its own header, measured 2026-08-18:

  > A restart of THIS unit does still kill every agent it is holding, and that is not a
  > configuration mistake — it is the mechanism. When a pty master closes, the slave returns
  > EOF, and any process reading its own tty exits; the scope then goes inactive because its
  > last process left. The transient scope protects against a cgroup kill, not against
  > losing a terminal.

  So the real cost is: **every held agent EXITS.** Measured at the time of writing, the owner
  held **11**, across five projects, and one of them was the session doing this work. The
  conversations are resumable from their transcripts (`recover`), but whatever is in flight
  in each of them is not.

  The lesson is the one this repository keeps paying for: a summary is not a source. The
  claim was written from a plausible reading of "sibling scope" rather than from the file
  that documents the mechanism, and it was quoted back to the user as the basis for a
  decision.

### B-109 — three tracked files block every push: a consumer project's name in a spec, and two absolute home paths

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, running `set-leakscan` as task 9.3 of
  `agent-provider-selection`. Not a task in that change — none of the three files belongs
  to it, and one belongs to a change that was archived months ago.
- **measured:** `set-leakscan` over the unpushed range, 124 files scanned, three findings,
  all marked `[BLOCKS]`:

  ```
  consumer-name  openspec/changes/fleet-input-attention/tasks.md:106
  home-path      openspec/bugs/README.md:252
  home-path      openspec/changes/work-cycle-run-visibility/tasks.md:16
  ```

  The first is the serious one and it is a rule breach, not a style issue: a consumer
  project is named in a tracked file in a **public** repository, which
  [external project confidentiality](../../CLAUDE.md) forbids outright. The other two are
  `/home/<user>/...` paths, which publish the local username and directory layout —
  the release-safety rule's check 4.

- **the direction it fails in:** silently, and for everyone. `set-leakscan` blocks the
  push, so nothing has leaked — but the block is on the RANGE, so these three lines now
  stop *any* session from pushing *any* work until they are fixed. The cost lands on
  whoever pushes next, not on whoever wrote them, and nothing in the authoring moment
  said anything was wrong.

- **what would prove it fixed:** `set-leakscan` exits 0 on the unpushed range, and
  `set-leakscan --tree` reports no `consumer-name` finding at all. Re-running is seconds.

- **what NOT to do:** do not add these to `~/.config/set-core/leakscan-allow.txt`. The
  allow file is for deliberate exceptions — the user's own public repos — and a consumer
  name is never one. Fix the text: a neutral name (`the consumer project`) for the first,
  a `~`-relative or `<user>`-placeholder path for the other two.

### B-108 — a unit does everything right and then does not commit: the engine's own run-state exclusion turns a silently-ignored directory into a hard `git add` failure

- **state:** CLOSED (2026-08-29, `368ece07`) — the entry stays; see the closing measurement below
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, from the first REAL work unit ever driven from
  the fleet screen (`work-cycle-run-visibility` task 7.4). Not a task in that change: the
  defect is in the engine's commit path, not in the screen that started the run.
- **measured:** the run finished with `verdict: GROUP_DONE`, `gate: passed` and the product
  correct on disk (`docs/work-cycle-proof/NOTE.md` = `group one ran`), and then recorded
  `commit: {committed: false, reason: "git add failed"}`. Reproduced with the engine's own
  argv (`engine.py:426`), run as a subprocess so no agent-side hook could interfere:

  ```
  git -C <tree> add -A -- . :(exclude)set/runtime/work-cycle
  → exit 1
    The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
    set/runtime
  ```

  The mechanism, isolated by varying only the pathspec on the same tree:

  | pathspec | exit |
  |---|---|
  | `-- .` (no exclude) | **0** — an ignored directory is skipped silently |
  | `-- . :(exclude)set/runtime/work-cycle` | **1** |
  | `-- . :(exclude)set/runtime` | **1** |
  | `-- . :(exclude)set` | **0** |

  So an `:(exclude)` pathspec pointing *inside* a gitignored directory makes git treat that
  directory as explicitly named, and the silent skip becomes a hard error. The exclusion
  exists to keep the engine's run state out of the project's history — and it is the run
  state's own directory, created by the first run, that then breaks that run's commit.
- **who it hits:** any adopting project whose runtime area is gitignored. That is set-core
  itself (`.gitignore:69 /set/*`), and it is the shape the engine's own design recommends.
  It cannot appear before the first run, which is why every unit test passed: the failing
  condition is *created by* the thing under test.
- **fail direction — the expensive one:** everything reports success. Verdict green, gate
  green, product on disk. Only the commit field says otherwise, and it says
  `git add failed`, which names the command and not the cause. The work stays uncommitted in
  the tree, and a later reader sees a change with no commits and concludes the unit did
  nothing. Same class as B-105 and B-107: a true statement about the symptom, pointing away
  from the cause.
- **second, smaller defect in the same line:** `CommitOutcome(False, reason="git add failed")`
  discards git's stderr, which said exactly what was wrong. The reason must carry the cause.
- **fixed when:** a unit run in a project whose run-state directory is gitignored records a
  commit sha, AND a deliberately broken `git add` records git's own message. A test that only
  proves the exclusion string is present proves the mechanism, not the result.
- **CLOSED 2026-08-29, `368ece07`, with the measurement it asked for.** The fix asks git
  whether it already ignores the run state (`check-ignore`) and keeps the exclusion only
  where it does not; `check-ignore`'s own failure (128) is not read as "ignored", so an error
  leaves the protection in place rather than dropping it. The reason now carries git's
  sentence.

  **Proved live, not only in a test.** Group 2 of the same change, started from the same
  screen, into the same worktree that produced this entry:

  ```
  commit: {committed: true, sha: 3498603b68ec20e1b7adecc7ded07bce936b3722}
  git show --name-only 3498603b | grep '^set/runtime'   → 0 lines
  ```

  The product went in (`NOTE.md` two lines, in group order; `proof/slugify.py`;
  `tests_proof/`), the engine's own bookkeeping did not, and the tree came back clean.
  Mutation-tested as well: restoring the old argv reproduces the exact live failure text in
  the `reason`, while the not-ignored branch stays green; the restore was verified
  byte-identical by sha256.

  ⚠ **What the old test got wrong is worth keeping.** It asserted the argv and said so in its
  own docstring — *"asserted on the argv rather than on a real repository"*. The argv was
  correct; git's answer to it was not, and a fake runner cannot disagree with the command it
  is handed. The replacement drives a real repository.

### B-107 — an engine-side refusal never reaches the caller; the scope's wording does

- **state:** open (partially addressed — see below)
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, while doing the browser check for
  `work-cycle-run-visibility`. Not a task in that change: the change's own start-integrity
  requirement covers refusals the framework can know BEFORE the exec, and this one happens
  inside the child.
- **measured:** live against the running dashboard, `POST /api/fleet/units` with a seat that
  names a project (which the engine refuses by design):

  ```
  {"detail":"set-agent-unit-…-set-core.scope: systemd reports no cgroup;
             cannot verify survival; the agent was not started"}   HTTP 409
  ```

  The engine's actual sentence — *seat 'set-core' does not identify a single agent session;
  a seat that names only a project matches every live session in it* — went to the pty and
  was never read. Same class as B-105 one layer along: a true statement about the symptom,
  pointing away from the cause. A second run of the same request produced
  `did not become active` instead, so the failure surfaces through more than one path.
- **partially addressed (`<this change>`):** the owner now drains the pty before closing it
  and appends what the child said (`_drain`, `owner.py`), with the control sequences stripped.
  ⚠ **Unit-tested and NOT verified live:** re-running the measurement above after the fix
  produced no captured text — the child had not written by the time `adopt` gave up, or the
  data was gone. So the mechanism exists and the RESULT is unproven, which is exactly the
  distinction this register asks for.
- **fixed when:** the measurement above returns the engine's own sentence. A test that only
  proves `_drain` can read a pipe does not close this — it proves the mechanism, and the
  mechanism is not what was missing.
- ⚠ **numbered B-106 first, and that number was already taken** by a parallel session four
  minutes earlier. Re-measured with the register's own command before renumbering — which is
  the rule this file states in its rule 3, and which measuring once at the start of a session
  is not enough to satisfy when somebody else is writing to the same file.

### B-106 — `--allowedTools` restricts nothing, so a permission mode named after it is a guard that only reports being one

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by a peer agent on the `set-glm` channel, from a
  consumer project's own run: a review subagent was invoked although `Agent` was
  absent from the allow list, did not return, and a 60-minute ceiling then cut off
  work that was already finished (11/11 tasks, 57 green tests, `tsc` clean)
  **without a commit**. Their measurement ran on a non-Anthropic provider.
- **measured HERE, on the Anthropic branch, because a conclusion that crosses to
  the other side's runtime has to be measured there.** Empty temp directory,
  `--settings` pointing at `{"permissions":{"defaultMode":"default","allow":[],"deny":[]}}`
  so no user setting can explain the result:

  | run | flags | result | `permission_denials` |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | `--allowedTools 'Read'` | Bash **ran** — `"A parancs lefutott, az output: SZIA"` | `[]` |
  | 2 | + clean `--settings` | Bash **ran** — `"Lefuttattam, az output: SZIA"` | `[]` |
  | 3 | `--allowedTools 'Read' --disallowedTools 'Bash'` | Bash **absent** — the model answers that it has no Bash tool | `[]` |

  So the allow list does not restrict, and it is not an `Agent`-specific
  exemption: a tool absent from it is callable in general. `--disallowedTools`
  does work — and it works by **removing the tool from the session**, not by
  denying a call.

- ⚠ **`permission_denials` is NOT the discriminator, and an obvious test would be
  blind here.** It is `[]` in all three runs — in the broken case because nothing
  was denied, in the fixed case because there was nothing left to deny. A check
  asserting on that field sees no difference between a working guard and an absent
  one. Assert on **whether the tool ran**.

- **what this costs us:** `lib/editor.sh:134` offers an operator a permission mode
  literally named `allowedTools`, emitting
  `--allowedTools "Edit,Write,Bash,Read,Glob,Grep,Task"`. `lib/loop/engine.sh:402`
  passes the same flag through `eval`. The name states a restriction that the flag
  does not keep for any tool — so the earlier reading of this entry ("`Agent` is
  missing from the list") named the wrong defect: adding `Agent` to the list would
  have changed nothing at all.

- **fixed when:** a run under the `allowedTools` mode is given a prompt that asks
  for a tool the mode does not list, and the tool does **not** run. The remedy
  measured above is `--disallowedTools <the tools the mode means to exclude>`
  alongside the allow list; the mode is then renamed to what it actually does.

- **related:** the provider/model selection work in flight passes flags to the same
  CLI, so whatever this settles applies there too.

### B-105 — the fleet's work-unit start names an engine command the owner cannot resolve, and the refusal blames the scope

- **state:** closed (`4fddfc7f`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-29 by this session, while measuring how far the work-cycle engine is
  from being startable from the screen. Not a task in `work-cycle-engine-apply-first`: the
  route and the console script both shipped there and both are correct in isolation — the
  defect is in the seam between them and only exists on an installed machine.
- **measured:** `POST /api/fleet/units` builds `argv[0] = "set-work-cycle"`
  (`lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:1509` `ENGINE_COMMAND`), the owner passes it to
  `os.execvpe` through `child_env = dict(os.environ)` (`lib/set_orch/fleet/owner.py:162`,
  `lib/set_orch/fleet/scopes/_systemd.py:169`), and the owner's own PATH does not contain it:

  ```
  $ tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/<owner-pid>/environ | grep ^PATH=
  PATH=~/.local/bin:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
  $ env -i PATH=<that> sh -c 'command -v set-work-cycle'   # empty
  ```

  The console script exists **only inside the repo's venv** (`.venv/bin/set-work-cycle`);
  `~/.local/bin` holds the other `set-*` tools (`set-work`, `set-orch-core`) but not this one,
  and the `set-web` unit pins the same PATH (`Environment=PATH=…`, no venv). So the route
  cannot start a unit on this machine at all.

  ⚠ **This entry first claimed the route answers `200` with a label and a pid. Measured, and
  it does not** — the correction is kept because the wrong prediction is the reusable part.
  Probed directly with the owner's PATH:

  ```
  $ env -i PATH=<owner PATH> XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=... systemd-run --user --scope --collect \
      --quiet --unit=set-b105-probe.scope set-work-cycle --help
  Failed to find executable set-work-cycle: No such file or directory   # exit 1
  $ systemctl --user show set-b105-probe.scope -p ActiveState -p LoadState
  LoadState=not-found   ActiveState=inactive
  ```

  No scope registers, so `await_unit` spins its full 40 × 0.1 s and `adopt` raises
  `ScopeError("<unit> did not become active")`, which the owner re-raises as
  `OwnerError(… "; the agent was not started")` and the route turns into a **409**. The real
  defect is therefore narrower and of a class this repo already names: **the failure is
  attributed to the wrong cause.** The caller waits four seconds and is told the scope did not
  become active — a true sentence about the symptom that points away from the missing command,
  which is the one thing a reader could act on.
- **fixed when:** the engine command resolves from the owner's environment on a machine where
  the framework is installed — `env -i PATH=<owner PATH> sh -c 'command -v set-work-cycle'`
  prints a path — **and** an unresolvable command is refused by name before a scope is claimed,
  with a test that holds the measured shape: unresolvable command → refusal naming the command
  and the environment, no four-second wait, and no `did not become active` in the message.
- **closed:** 2026-08-29, `4fddfc7f`, both halves. **Behaviour:** `resolve_in_env(command, env)`
  runs on the child's final environment before `pty.fork()`, and an unresolvable command raises
  `CommandNotResolvable` naming the command and the PATH. **Installation:** `bin/set-work-cycle`
  beside the other tools, symlinked into `~/.local/bin`. Re-ran the entry's own measurement:

  ```
  $ env -i PATH=<owner PATH> sh -c 'command -v set-work-cycle'
  ~/.local/bin/set-work-cycle
  ```

  Mutation-tested rather than asserted: without the guard 2 of the 4 tests fail, without the
  child-exit report 1 fails, all 4 pass with both, and the restore was verified byte-identical.

  ⚠ **The entry is kept because its FIRST reading was wrong** — it predicted a false `200`, and
  the guard that prediction implied would have gone in the wrong place. What was actually there
  was a four-second wait ending in a true sentence about the wrong thing.

### B-102 — `last_movement_seconds` is read from a log file that is rewritten without new entries

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-28 by this session, while measuring the runtime session record for
  `fleet-input-attention`. Not a task in that change: its specs put every other consumer of
  the log's mtime explicitly out of scope, and this one is a defect in a field that shipped
  long before it.
- **measured:** for each live session, the log's `mtime` compared with the timestamp of the
  newest ENTRY inside it. **2 of 10** logs had an mtime **90 min** and **58 min** later than
  any entry they held; the record's `statusUpdatedAt` matched the newest entry in **10 of 10**.
  So the file is rewritten (a `file-history-snapshot` line appears at the tail of one of them)
  while the conversation has not moved. Every surface that reads `last_movement_seconds` — the
  project row's "stalest agent here", the freshest/stalest pair, the tile — therefore reports a
  session as having moved up to an hour and a half more recently than it did. Fail direction is
  the reassuring one: a stopped session looks fresh.
- **fixed when:** `last_movement_seconds` comes from the newest entry the tail actually holds
  (or the record's stamp), a unit test holds the measured shape — mtime touched now, newest
  entry an hour old, reported movement an hour — and the fleet screen's stalest column stops
  disagreeing with the same session's own last log line.

### B-104 — the docs, an agent rule, a LIVE spec and the public site all instruct people to run `set-design-sync`, which does not exist

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-28 by this session, while correcting one presentation slide as part of
  `retire-figma-legacy`. Recorded as its own entry rather than as a note under B-101: a finding
  filed inside a CLOSED bug is a finding nobody will look for.
- **measured:** the command does not exist in any form — `git ls-files | grep -i "design.sync"`
  is empty, `find . -name "*design-sync*"` (untracked included) is empty, there is no
  `console_scripts` entry, nothing named it in `bin/`, and nothing on `PATH` answers to it.
  Meanwhile 11 LIVE files instruct the reader to run it (42 tracked files mention it; the rest
  are archived changes, which are history and correctly keep the old name):

  | file | what it does with the name |
  |---|---|
  | `openspec/specs/design-integration-docs/spec.md:11,14` | **a LIVE spec** requiring the docs to describe `run set-design-sync` |
  | `.claude/rules/design-bridge.md:38` | **an agent rule** stating it generates `design-system.md` pre-orchestration |
  | `.claude/skills/set/write-spec/SKILL.md` | a live skill |
  | `docs/www/index.html:778,948,1153` | **the public site — line 1153 is a COPY BUTTON for the command** |
  | `docs/guide/{README,design-integration,orchestration,sentinel,writing-specs}.md`, `docs/learn/journey.md`, `docs/roadmap.md` | prose instructions |

- **it was replaced, not lost** — which is what makes the fix concrete rather than a deletion:
  `375b8701` (2026-04-18, *"replace Figma pipeline with v0-only design source (BREAKING)"*)
  swapped it for `modules/web/bin/set-design-import` and `set-design-hygiene`. The tool moved
  into the web module and changed name; the documentation never followed.
- **why this outranks B-101 even though it is the same class:** B-101's stale spec was read by
  agents and by a peer tracing provenance. This one is read by **a person evaluating set-core**,
  and the public site gives them a button that copies a command their shell will reject with
  `command not found`. The fail direction is toward a first-run failure by someone with no way
  to know the docs are wrong.
- **fixed when:** the 11 live carriers name the tool that exists (`set-design-import` /
  `set-design-hygiene`) or drop the step, `grep -rn "set-design-sync"` returns only archived
  changes and this register, and the site's copy button copies a command that runs. Check the
  claim the same way it was found: run what the docs tell you to run.

### B-103 — the repo's own regression-baseline recipe manufactures a false diff every time it runs

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-28 by this session, while running the `regression-baseline` procedure as
  a task of `retire-figma-legacy`. Not a task in that change: it is a defect in the measuring
  instrument, not in what was being measured. Filed as B-102 and renumbered on the spot — a
  parallel session in this checkout had already taken that id. Second time this has happened
  (see B-100); two sessions numbering from one file is a collision the file cannot prevent.
- **measured:** `tests/unit/test_paths.py::TestResolveProjectName::test_resolve_with_explicit_path`
  asserts the checkout's DIRECTORY NAME — `repo_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`, then
  `assert resolve_project_name(str(repo_root)) == repo_root.name`. The skill's recipe creates the
  baseline worktree at a path whose last segment is `base`, so the test fails there and passes in
  the working tree: `AssertionError: assert 'set-core' == 'base'`. Measured today: baseline 116
  failure entries, working tree 115, and that one entry is the whole difference.
- **why it matters more than one line of diff:** the set diff is the ONLY check this repo trusts
  for a regression, precisely because the failure counts are meaningless against its debt. An
  instrument that always produces one spurious entry trains the reader to look at a non-empty
  diff and say "that one is fine" — and the next real single-test regression arrives looking
  exactly like it. Same class as the measurement being inside the corpus it measures: the
  procedure's own artifact shows up as a finding about the code.
- **fail direction:** toward waving a regression through, which is the expensive direction.
- **fixed when:** the baseline can be run without a spurious entry — either the skill's recipe
  names the worktree after the repo (`.../set-core` rather than `.../base`), or the test stops
  asserting the directory name, or the skill documents this single entry as expected. The first
  is the smallest and keeps the test's original intent (it exists because a hard-coded home path
  once made it pass for the wrong reason). Verify by running the recipe twice and getting an
  EMPTY diff on an unchanged tree — which is the property a baseline is supposed to have and
  currently does not.

### B-101 — a LIVE spec describes a function that was deleted four months ago

- **state:** closed (`5848af48`, `1aae12fd`, `466c1be7`, `d1fbf6ba`; archived as `2026-08-28-retire-figma-legacy`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-28 by a peer agent from another project over the cross-session
  socket, while tracing the provenance of this repo's Figma legacy. Not a task in any open
  change: nothing open touches the design pipeline.
- **measured:** `openspec/specs/figma-source-dispatch/spec.md` is a LIVE capability spec whose
  every scenario names `design_sources_for_dispatch()`. That function was removed by
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-04-27-v0-only-design-pipeline/tasks.md:113` (task 7.5), and
  `lib/design/` no longer exists at all — `git ls-files | grep 'lib/design/'` returns nothing.
  The spec's own Purpose line reads `TBD — restored after delta-sync structural cleanup`, which
  names the carrier: the code left, a structural delta-sync put the spec back, and it has stood
  as a live contract ever since. Same shape as the false-value class in
  `.claude/rules/evidence-discipline.md` — the system still publishes something it stopped
  standing behind, and it reads as current to anyone who opens `openspec/specs/`.
- **two dead carriers found with it, both zero-reference:** `scripts/fetch-figma-design.py`
  (700 lines; `grep -rn 'fetch-figma-design'` finds only its own docstring and archived
  changes) and `tests/fixtures/figma-raw/TEST/sources/*.tsx` (4 files; no `.py`/`.sh`/`.ts`
  file references them — the test that used them tested the deleted function).
- **NOT part of this, and the correction worth keeping:** `docs/images/auto/figma/*.png` look
  like dead Figma leftovers and are not. `scripts/build-presentation.py:298` passes
  `storefront-design.png` to a slide, and `docs/presentation/set-core-presentation.md:326` /
  `set-core-bemutato.md:347` embed it. Deleting them breaks the presentation build. Their own
  defect is different and smaller: the slide still asserts a dropped mechanism
  (`Spec + Figma Design`, note `set-design-sync extracts Figma tokens`).
- **fixed / verified 2026-08-28**, through the OpenSpec change `retire-figma-legacy` (it
  withdraws a published capability, so it carried a spec delta rather than going in as a
  direct commit):
  - `openspec/specs/figma-source-dispatch/` no longer exists — not as a directory, not as an
    empty file. `openspec archive` performed the removal itself:
    `Retiring …: all requirements removed. Totals: + 0, ~ 0, - 6, → 0`.
  - both dead carriers deleted (−859 lines), each preceded by a proving grep restricted to
    code file types, whose EMPTY output was the licence to delete.
  - inventory 12 → 6 (4 archived figma-named files + the 2 presentation PNGs); the 6 that left
    are exactly the intended ones.
  - `openspec validate --all --strict`: `316 passed / 146 failed (462)` → `315 / 146 (461)`.
    One item left, and it left the PASSING set. Zero new failures.
  - test failure-id SET: 116 → 115, the single difference being B-103's instrument artifact,
    not this change.
- **two things this cost that the next reader should not re-learn:**
  - **Do not delete the spec by hand before archiving.** With the file already gone, archive
    reads the delta as `create`, discards all six REMOVED requirements as "nothing to remove",
    and aborts on an empty spec. The archive step IS the removal mechanism.
  - **An all-REMOVED delta needs `retire_capabilities: true` in the change's `.openspec.yaml`.**
    The CLI names it in its own error text, but no schema instruction mentions it up front.
- **found while fixing, deliberately NOT swept in:** `set-design-sync` — the tool the
  presentation slide credited — does not exist in this repository at all
  (`git ls-files | grep design-sync` is empty; not on `PATH`), yet 10+ documentation files
  describe it. The slide was corrected as part of this change; the other documents were left
  alone and are a separate finding. `tests/fixtures/design-snapshot.md` is a second
  zero-reference orphan beside the deleted fixture, also left alone.

### B-100 — the Control Center draws 0 % for an account whose usage was never measured

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, while moving the measurement out of the GUI for
  `fleet-account-usage-bars`. Filed as B-93 and renumbered on merge: a parallel session in the
  same checkout had already published a different B-93. Two sessions numbering from the same
  file is a collision the file cannot prevent on its own — the one that reached `origin` first
  keeps the id. Not a task in that change: its specs put the Control Center's own
  rendering explicitly OUT OF SCOPE.
- **measured:** running the shipped `UsageWorker.fetch_claude_api_usage` against the three
  configured browser accounts, one of them answered `available: true, session_pct: 0,
  has_weekly: false, weekly_pct: 0` — while the upstream document for that account carried
  `five_hour: null` and `seven_day: null`. The `or 0` in `_fetch_org_usage`
  (`gui/workers/usage.py`) turns *no figure* into *zero consumed*, and `update_usage_bars` then
  paints an empty bar, which is the most confident mark on the strip.
- **the direction it fails in:** reassuring. A quota nobody could measure reads as a quota nobody
  has spent, on the account most likely to be the one in trouble.
- **fixed when:** an account whose window the upstream did not fill renders a mark that says so
  rather than an empty bar, and a test drives `_fetch_org_usage` with a null-window document and
  asserts the two states are distinguishable. The headless module already keeps them apart
  (`OUTCOME_UNMEASURED` in `lib/set_orch/usage/client.py`); the GUI's own mapping does not.

### B-99 — the checkout guard blocks a merge commit and prints a remedy git itself refuses

- **state:** fixed — `3bbc7ef6`.
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, hitting it while committing a merge.
- **measured:** `git merge origin/main` staged 60 paths — none of them staged by
  any session, all of them put there by the merge — and the guard read the whole
  set as another session's work:

  ```
  BLOCKED by set-hook-checkout-guard — this commit would carry work another
  session in this checkout is holding.
      git commit -- <path> <path> ...
  $ git commit -m x -- base.txt
  fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge.
  ```

- **which way it fails:** it is the shape that gets a guard bypassed rather than
  obeyed. The refusal is correct-looking, and the only command it offers is one
  git rejects, so the sole way forward is `--no-verify` — and a guard people learn
  to `--no-verify` past is worse than an absent one, because it still reports that
  it is holding. The blindness is not about merges specifically: the guard reasons
  about *who staged a path*, and a merge stages paths with no session behind them.
- **fixed when:** a merge, cherry-pick or revert commit passes, a pathspec-less
  commit over a foreign staged path in the same repository is still refused once
  the merge is finished, and git's own refusal of the partial commit is asserted
  rather than assumed. All three held in `tests/unit/test_checkout_guard.py`;
  both mutation directions (removing the exemption, making it unconditional) fail
  the suite.

### B-98 — a fleet payload test's fake agent lacks `session_log`, so the whole payload builder raises

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, while merging `origin/main`.
- **measured:** on `origin/main` **alone**, in a detached worktree with nothing of
  this session's work in it:

  ```
  $ PYTHONPATH=lib:modules/web/src:modules/example/src python3.12 -m pytest \
      tests/unit/test_fleet_discovery.py::test_a_recorded_origin_outranks_ancestry_and_says_which_it_is -q
  FAILED  ...  AttributeError: '_A' object has no attribute 'session_log'
  lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:114  in _cache_payload:  heat = read_cache_heat(agent.session_log)
  ```

  `_cache_payload` is new (`9437605d`); the test's local `_A` fake predates it and
  was never extended, so `_agent_payload` raises before reaching the assertion.
- **which way it fails:** it is loud in the suite and silent about its subject. The
  test's own claim — a recorded origin outranks ancestry — is now **unmeasured**,
  and has been since the cache-heat commit landed: a test that raises before its
  first assertion is a dead test, and a dead test that also reports red is the one
  people route around. Nothing else covers that precedence.
- **fixed when:** `_A` carries a `session_log` (or `_cache_payload` tolerates a fake
  that has none), the test passes, and mutating the origin precedence back to
  ancestry makes it fail again — i.e. it measures its subject rather than merely
  running.

### B-96 — a restored agent whose session gets claimed elsewhere stays alive as a record-less, log-less zombie

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user — *"restore nem mukodott probaltam fleet-ben uj
  sessionben restolreolni"* — with a screenshot showing the restored tile empty.
- **measured:** the owner log records the restore:

  ```
  21:29:15 fleet owner: started set-core-restored as set-agent-set-core-restored.scope
           (pid 9289), resumed session <S>
  ```

  Twenty-seven seconds later a SECOND process (pid 9467) claimed the same session
  `<S>` — the user's own terminal resuming it. The loser is pid 9289, and hours
  later it is still there:

  ```
  $ ps -p 9289 -o args=
  claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --resume <S>
  $ ls ~/.claude/sessions/9289.json      ->  does not exist
  ```

  So it holds a pty, appears in `/api/fleet/agents` as an agent with
  `session_id = null`, shows *"the log is readable and holds no conversation"*,
  and the roster records it as `no-session:<project>/pid-9289` with
  `not_resumable_reason: "no session id was ever recorded for this agent"` —
  **un-restorable for ever.**
- **the guard is NOT broken, and that is the point.** `owner._refuse_if_the_session_is_running`
  was verified working the same day: recovering a session held by a live probe agent
  was refused with the right message. The check runs BEFORE the start, and the
  collision happens after it. Time-of-check to time-of-use, on a window the
  framework does not own — the other claimant is a human's terminal.
- **which way it fails:** silently, and it accumulates. Nothing errors, the restore
  reports `started`, and the fleet gains an agent that can never be recovered and
  never says why. Two live processes on one session is the design's own §6.1
  failure, reached around the guard rather than through it.
- **fixed when:** a restored agent that has not registered a session record within a
  bounded window is reported as such on its tile and offered for stopping — and
  the roster does not record a `no-session:` entry for a pid the framework itself
  started with a KNOWN session id. Note the second half: the framework passed
  `--resume <S>`, so it knows what that agent was meant to be, and writing
  `no-session` throws away a fact it already had.

### B-97 — the restore panel prints the current offer and the last result side by side, so they contradict each other

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user, same screenshot as B-86.
- **measured:** the header reads, on one line:

  ```
  Restore 0 of 1 - 1 cannot be resumed        All 1 restored.
  ```

  `web/src/lib/fleetRoster.ts:238` builds the first from the CURRENT roster
  (`restorable = resumable && !running`), and `:149` builds the second from the
  RESULT of the last restore call. Two answers to two different questions at two
  different times, rendered adjacent with nothing marking either.
- **which way it fails:** the reader believes the more reassuring one. "All 1
  restored" is what a person takes away, while the agent it refers to is the empty
  tile below it. Same class as a deprecated value sitting beside its replacement —
  the one the ui-quality rule was written after.
- **fixed when:** the result carries its own time or is visibly a past act, and the
  offer is not readable as a statement about it. A screenshot of the same state
  shows a reader which is which without being told.

### B-94 — `sac agents --json` prints the human listing, so the fleet reads "the bus could not be asked who exists"

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, from the fleet screen during the visual
  check of the `macos-fleet-discovery` change. Not that change's defect: it is a
  flag on an external CLI, not a process fact.
- **measured:** `instruct` shells out for the bus roster and parses stdout as JSON.
  The service log carries, on every listing:

  ```
  [WARNING] set_orch.fleet.instruct: fleet instruct: the bus roster did not parse:
            Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
  ```

  Run by hand, `sac agents --json` writes the **human** listing — aligned columns,
  tree glyphs, prose — and exits 0. There is no JSON on stdout to parse. (The
  output names third-party projects, so it is described here by shape and not
  quoted; see External Project Confidentiality.)
- **what it costs on the screen:** the agent tile shows *"we could not ask what
  this agent says about itself"* and *"no input: the messaging bus could not be
  asked who exists"* for an agent whose seat is in fact enrolled. False absence,
  and the panel offers enrolment for something already enrolled.
- **which way it fails:** safe in that nothing is acted on, useless in that the
  state can never clear. Same shape as a permanent "undeterminable".
- **fixed when:** with a live enrolled seat, the fleet listing reports the agent as
  instructable and the WARNING stops appearing. Decide first WHERE: if the CLI is
  meant to honour `--json`, that is its bug; if the framework is calling a flag
  that never existed, the caller is wrong and should say so rather than warn.

### B-95 — the dashboard's stderr log is unbounded and had reached 1.47 GB

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, while looking for the cause of B-84.
- **measured:**

  ```
  -rw-r--r--  1 <user> staff  1472625386  ~/Library/Logs/set-core/set-web.err
  ```

  1.47 GB, and the tail is DEBUG-level: one `module_install: no project
  declaration` and one `fleet capabilities: 4 checked` line per poll, plus a
  `watchfiles: rust notify timeout, continuing` roughly once a second. The launchd
  plist redirects stderr to a fixed path with no rotation and no size cap.
- **which way it fails:** silently, and then all at once. Nothing degrades until
  the disk does, and the log carries working directories and project names, so it
  is also a growing pile of exactly the content the confidentiality rule says must
  not accumulate where it can leave the machine.
- **fixed when:** the service's stderr is bounded — rotated, size-capped, or the
  per-poll DEBUG lines demoted — and a fresh run over an hour grows the file by a
  bounded amount that somebody has actually measured.

### B-93 — a waiter started through the `sac` PATH symlink is invisible to the waiters panel

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, while capturing a real waiter as a
  baseline for the `macos-fleet-discovery` change. Not a task in that change: the
  matcher is platform-independent and the change only moves where process facts
  come from.
- **measured:** `instruct.py:_is_waiter_argv` requires `argv[1].endswith("sac.mjs")`.
  A waiter started as documented in the tool's own help (`sac wait <room>`) runs as:

  ```
  $ ps -p 47091 -o pid=,args=
  47091 node /opt/homebrew/bin/sac wait scratch-portcheck

  >>> instruct._is_waiter_argv(['node','/opt/homebrew/bin/sac','wait','scratch-portcheck'])
  False
  >>> instruct.live_waiters()          # while that waiter is alive
  []
  ```

  `argv[1]` is the PATH symlink, which has no extension. The installed form —
  `<node> <prefix>/bin/sac.mjs wait <rooms>`, baked in by `sac install` — does end
  in `sac.mjs` and IS matched, which is why the panel works at all and why this
  went unnoticed.
- **the narrower statement, because the wider one is wrong:** the panel is not
  blind to waiters. It is blind to waiters a human started by typing the command
  the help text prints. Both forms run the same script.
- **which way it fails:** false absence. A live waiter is reported as no waiter, so
  the panel invites installing one that is already running, and `remove_waiter`
  refuses that pid with *"this pid is not a waiter process"* — a true-sounding
  reason that is not the real one.
- **fixed when:** with a waiter started as `sac wait <room>`, `live_waiters()`
  returns it, and a shell whose command line merely contains the word still does
  not match. Resolve the symlink, or test the script rather than the spelling of
  the path — the identity is the file that runs, not the name it was reached by.

### B-92 — the project header's icon buttons align on the BASELINE, so one of them sits 8 px high

- **state:** closed as no-longer-reproducible — the CAUSE was removed by `fa6d4162`, not by a
  fix aimed at this. Kept because the structure that produced it is still there.
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user, with a screenshot circling the file-view icon in the
  project header — *"fejlécben a file ikon missalligned"*.
- **measured:** on the bundle the user was looking at (`540349b2`), in Chromium:
  `[data-fleet-files-open] svg` top **60**, `[data-fleet-columns] svg` top **68** — the file
  icon sat **8 px** above the four layout glyphs beside it. The row is
  `flex items-baseline`, and a `<button>` whose only child is an SVG has no text baseline, so
  it aligns differently from the `<span class="flex">` the column glyphs live in. What made
  the difference visible was the row's other content: a text label (`layout`) and a two-line
  block, both of which put the row's baseline somewhere neither icon could meet.
- **why it no longer shows:** `fa6d4162` (a parallel session, converting the header to icons
  and numbers) removed the `layout` label. Measured after it, same page: delta **0**, and in
  the rendered pixels the ink of every icon in that row centres on the same row — folder-tree
  47..54, the glyphs 46..55, midpoint 50.5 for both.
- **what is NOT fixed:** the row is still `items-baseline` and the file button is still a
  text-less flex item of it. Any text put back into that row can reproduce this. An isolated
  rig rebuilt from the same classes did NOT reproduce it, so the exact trigger is a
  combination of that row's contents rather than the label alone — which is why this is
  recorded rather than "fixed" with a change nobody can prove.
- **fixed when:** the header's icon controls sit in one `items-center` group, so their
  alignment to each other does not depend on what text shares the row.

### B-91 — a rename test asserts a `carried` dict that gained a key three commits ago
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, hit while adding the fleet tab's cache
  field. Not caused by that work — see below.
- **measured:** `tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py::test_a_rename_carries_the_record_and_the_layout`
  asserts `answer["carried"] == {"record": 1, "docked": 1, "splits": 1}`; the
  route now also returns `agent_order`, so the equality fails. Confirmed
  pre-existing by running that one test against `git show HEAD:lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py`
  copied over the working file — it fails identically, and the working diff at the
  time touched only `_cache_payload` and its two call sites.
- **cause:** `4ecac3a5` (agent tabs became hand-orderable) added `agent_order` to
  the rename's `carried` report without updating the assertion that enumerates it.
  The test uses `==` on the whole dict, so a fourth carried document is a failure
  rather than a pass — which is the right choice for a test about *what a rename
  carries*, and means the assertion is simply out of date.
- **what would prove it fixed:** the assertion names all four carried documents
  and the test passes; and a fifth carried document still fails it, so the
  equality keeps doing its job.
- **why it matters more than one red test:** the fleet unit file is where the
  confidentiality guard lives (`test_the_session_record_never_reaches_the_payload`).
  A file that is already red is a file where the next red goes unnoticed.

### B-89 — the desktop guard measures the PERMISSION BIT, but what runs a file is the MIME handler

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `38a534c6`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user — *"ami necces továbbra is tool open pl xdg"* — and
  measured the same hour.
- **measured:** `desktop.py:114` refuses a path when `os.access(target, os.X_OK)`. That is a
  proxy for "would this run", and the thing itself is the desktop's file association. On this
  machine, with a 644 file and no executable bit anywhere:

  ```
  harmless.jar    guard: ÁTENGEDI  →  handler: openjdk-7-java.desktop
  harmless.py     guard: ÁTENGEDI  →  handler: org.gnome.gedit.desktop
  harmless.html   guard: ÁTENGEDI  →  handler: google-chrome.desktop
  ```

  A `.jar` is data by permission and a program by association — `xdg-open` hands it to a JVM
  that executes it. `.appimage`, `.run`, `.jnlp`, `.msi` and a macro-carrying office document
  are the same shape. `.html` is milder but not nothing: it opens at a `file://` origin, which
  can read local files. The `.desktop` suffix is refused by name, which shows the author
  already knew the class — the list was just one item long.

  Scale, from the same 30-transcript corpus: after the pending change routes everything it
  can into the internal viewer, **218 distinct tokens still reach `xdg-open`**, and 10 of them
  carry a suffix whose handler runs or actively interprets the content.

  The fail direction is the reason this is filed rather than noted: the guard reads as
  complete (*"executable files are not opened"*), and a reader checking it will conclude the
  route is safe. It is safe against one carrier out of several.
- **fixed when:** a 644 `.jar` is refused by `refusal()` with a reason naming the association
  rather than the bit, and a test asserts the refusal for a file with NO executable bit set.
- **taken up as tasks 4b.1–4b.6 of `terminal-links-and-typed-file-view`** (2026-08-27,
  `89663af7`), with a `desktop-open` spec delta. Deliberately not a change of its own: that
  change rewrites what reaches this endpoint, and shipping it beside *"the desktop guards are
  unchanged"* would leave a completeness claim standing over this hole.
- **closed with evidence, `38a534c6`:** `refusal()` is restated by the ACT. A 644 `.jar`,
  `.appimage`, `.run`, `.jnlp`, `.msi`, an installer package and a macro-ENABLED office
  document are refused with a reason naming the association; `.html`, `.htm` and `.xhtml` are
  refused as a local page that can read this machine's files. The suffix rules run BEFORE the
  bit, so a `.jar` that also carries `+x` still names the association — the bit would send the
  reader to `chmod`, which fixes nothing. Held by four tests, and each one goes red under a
  mutation that removes its rule (the empty list, the missing `.html`, the bit check moved
  first, an over-wide list that would catch `.docx`).
- **what it did NOT become, stated because the list invites it:** `.py` stays allowed. Its
  handler in the same measurement was an editor, so the class is *"a file whose handler runs
  it"*, not *"a file some program understands"*. `.svg` stays allowed too — an image that
  opened before this change must still open, and the widening is a widening of refusals, not
  a place to add ones nobody measured.
- **the list is a FLOOR.** Associations are per-machine and per-user; the guard asks the local
  desktop nothing, and a test removes its access to `subprocess` and `shutil.which` to hold
  that. Same input, same verdict, on every machine — which is also the only way it is
  testable at all.

### B-83 — a text file with the executable bit set opens NOWHERE

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `89cca954` + `2579f8aa`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user, ctrl-clicking a shell script in a fleet terminal —
  screenshot showing `could not open <project>/scripts/gates/check-ko-log.sh: executable
  files are not opened`.
- **measured:** `desktop.py:114` refuses an executable, and that refusal is CORRECT — the
  route it guards is `xdg-open`, which would *run* the file. The defect is that the token
  reached that route at all: `terminalTarget` (`fleetFiles.ts:419`) hands anything the file
  view did not claim to the desktop, and the file view never claims a path outside the
  agent's own checkout. Over 30 session transcripts, **12 distinct tokens** named an existing
  file that is plain UTF-8 text AND carries `+x` — every one of them refused at both ends.
  The internal viewer only ever READS, so the executable bit is irrelevant to it.
- **fixed when:** a `.sh`, `.mjs` or `.cjs` inside a known project opens in the file view on
  ctrl-click, and `desktop.py:114` is still refusing the same path.

- **closed with evidence, SEEN on the live screen 2026-08-27:** ctrl-clicking
  `benchmark/evaluator/collect-results.sh` — mode 755 — in a fleet terminal opened it in the
  internal editor, syntax-highlighted, with the structure pane expanded to it. The endpoint
  no longer consults the executable bit at all (`files.py:read_file`), because reading
  returns bytes and starts nothing; the guard that refuses to RUN a file stays on the desktop
  route, where it belongs, and was widened rather than relaxed (see `B-89`).

### B-84 — the file view is confined to the agent's own checkout, so a file of another known project goes to the desktop

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `2579f8aa` + `00d11279`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, while measuring B-83.
- **measured:** `terminalTarget` resolves against ONE base (`cwd || root`) and consults ONE
  listing. Anything else falls through to the desktop. Over 30 transcripts, of the 823
  distinct tokens that reached the desktop route and name an existing path,
  **125 are text files sitting under a registered project root** — the backend
  (`files.py:_known_root`) would serve every one of them, because it accepts any registered
  project or a worktree of one. The common shape is a worktree agent printing an absolute
  path into the MAIN checkout. A further 204 text files are outside every registered root
  (`/tmp/…/scratchpad`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.claude`) — those legitimately stay a desktop
  hand-over unless the roots are widened, which is a separate decision.
- **fixed when:** a token naming a file under any registered project (or a worktree of one)
  opens in the file view, whichever checkout the agent is standing in.

- **closed with evidence, SEEN on the live screen 2026-08-27:** an absolute path into a
  SECOND registered project, ctrl-clicked in a set-core terminal, opened in the panel — and
  the panel header read `files set-core · set-agent-comm · README.md`, naming the checkout it
  was reading. The payload now ships each project's servable checkouts, derived from the same
  verdict the file endpoints apply, so the browser routes without asking the server about any
  path.

### B-85 — the absolute branch applies no shape filter, so every `/word` token becomes a link that fails on click

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `2579f8aa`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session, measuring the recogniser against real output.
- **measured:** `desktopReference` returns immediately for anything starting with `/`
  (`fleetFiles.ts:~330`) — `looksLikePath` guards the RELATIVE branch only. Over 30
  transcripts: **395 distinct single-segment absolute tokens, 1464 occurrences**, none of
  which is a filesystem path — a web app's routes, this framework's own slash commands
  (`/opsx:ff`, `/dd`), and component names. Each is underlined and answers
  `no such file or directory` when activated. Fail direction: it teaches the reader that
  underlines in a terminal are unreliable, which costs the real links too.
- **fixed when:** `/opsx:ff` and a single-segment route are plain text, while
  `/home/<user>/x/y.ts` and `/tmp/run.log` still link.

- **closed with evidence:** over the same 30-transcript corpus, the **425** single-segment
  absolute tokens that were underlined broken links are **0** — not one is still drawn as a
  link. They are recognised at LOW confidence instead of dropped, so `/tmp` and
  `~/bin/mytool` stay reachable on a held modifier while drawing nothing. SEEN on the live
  screen 2026-08-27: on one row, `openspec/changes/<name>/` underlined and `/opsx:ff` beside
  it plain.

### B-86 — the token cleaner does not survive markdown, table cells, or `~`

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `2579f8aa`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session.
- **measured:** `unwrap` strips `([<'"` + backtick at the head and `)]>,.;:'"` + backtick at
  the tail — not `*`, `|`, `{`, `}`. Of **249 distinct tokens that name a file which EXISTS
  and were nonetheless rendered as plain text**, the causes are: **121** leftover markup
  (``**`path`**`` bold, `` `path` `` inside bold, `path.md:12:|` from a table row),
  **86** a directory, **21** a `~/…` path (the tilde is not in `looksLikePath`'s character
  class and is never expanded), **15** a real file the listing does not carry because it is
  gitignored, **5** a non-ASCII filename. Agents write markdown constantly, so this is the
  single largest source of missed links.
- **fixed when:** ``**`src/app.ts`**``, `docs/x.md:12:|` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` all link
  to the same file a bare token does.

- **closed with evidence:** the single destructive strip is now a CANDIDATE LIST — the token
  as written plus each progressively unwrapped variant — and the listing is consulted before
  any candidate is allowed to place on its shape. Missed links over the corpus: **252 → 72**.
  A `~/` token is expanded against the home the SERVER sends; with no home supplied it stays
  text, because a browser guessing a home links to somebody else's file.

### B-87 — a directory cannot be opened in the file view at all

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `00d11279`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by this session.
- **measured:** the listing endpoint serves FILES, so no directory is ever in the known set,
  and the panel has no notion of "reveal this directory". Every directory therefore reaches
  `xdg-open`, which opens a desktop file manager beside the dashboard. Over 30 transcripts:
  **431 distinct directory tokens, 209 of them under a registered project root** — where the
  panel's own structure pane could expand and scroll to them instead.
- **fixed when:** ctrl-clicking `openspec/changes/<name>/` expands that node in the structure
  pane rather than opening a file manager.

- **closed with evidence, SEEN on the live screen 2026-08-27:** ctrl-clicking
  `openspec/changes/terminal-links-and-typed-file-view/` expanded `openspec` →
  `openspec/changes` → that node, scrolled it into view and marked it, and opened NO file —
  the editor pane still read *pick a file from the structure*. A reveal that finds nothing
  says so rather than doing nothing silently.

### B-90 — copying the fleet screen carries every visually-hidden sentence with it

- **state:** closed (this commit).
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user, who pasted a Ctrl+C of the fleet terminal panel into
  the chat: what arrived was 15 lines of tile-control explanations — *put this panel on the
  left — it takes its space out of the grid*, *stop the agent — a separate, explicit act* —
  none of which is on the screen, each preceded by the `￼` an SVG leaves behind.
- **measured:** in Chromium against the running dashboard, selecting `[data-fleet-terminal-header]`
  and reading `getSelection().toString()` yielded **668 characters, of which 4 were visible**
  (`live`). The carrier is `sr-only`, which only CLIPS the text to a 1px box — it stays
  selectable. 20 such spans render on the fleet screen; setting `user-select: none` on the 8
  in that header took the same selection to 4.
- **fixed when:** the same selection yields the visible text alone while the sentence stays in
  the DOM and in the accessible name. Verified after the fix, same page, same range: **4
  characters, `live`**, and over the whole document 0 of 20 hidden sentences appear in a
  full-page selection. `SrOnly` (`web/src/components/SrOnly.tsx`) is now the only way this
  screen renders hidden text; `tests/unit/srOnlyNotCopied.test.tsx` fails on a hand-written
  `sr-only` span, and `tests/e2e/fleet-terminal.spec.ts` makes the browser measurement.

### B-88 — a binary file has no view, only a refusal

- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-27 by `89cca954`
- **reported:** 2026-08-27 by the user — *"binárisra pedig képnézegetőt kellene csinálni,
  mime type szerint"*.
- **measured:** `files.py:395` answers `415 not a text file` for anything that is not UTF-8,
  and `FleetFileView` renders that as a sentence. Screenshots are the case that matters:
  agents write them constantly and print the path. Over 30 transcripts the desktop route
  received **59 existing binary files**, 5 of them PNG. `MAX_BYTES` is 2 MiB, which a
  full-page screenshot can exceed — the size refusal is separate from the type refusal and
  must stay honest about which one fired.
- **fixed when:** a PNG an agent printed opens as an image in the same panel, and a
  non-renderable binary states its type and size rather than "not a text file".

- **closed with evidence, SEEN on the live screen 2026-08-27:** `assets/icon.png` opened in
  the panel AS AN IMAGE, scaled to fit, stated as `image/png · 8.2 kB`, with no save control
  and a `blob:` source the panel built itself from bytes the server served as an attachment
  with `nosniff`. A PDF is named with its size and handed to the desktop rather than
  embedded — GitLab serves PDFs as downloads, Gitea's embedded viewer is blocked by its own
  `X-Frame-Options`, and a sandboxed frame may not render one at all.

### B-82 — the terminal replay ring buffer cuts at an arbitrary byte, so a tab switch can start mid-escape-sequence

- **state:** closed (`fba77d2c`) — the fix ships; it takes effect only when the owner
  service is restarted, which orphans every held agent, so WHEN that happens is the user's
  call and not this session's.
- **reported:** 2026-08-26 by the user, switching between agent tabs — *"még mindig van ilyen
  képernyő rajzolási hiba ha átváltok időnként. átméretezés megjavítja mindig"*, with a
  screenshot showing `55;1H` printed as literal text in the top-left corner of an otherwise
  near-empty terminal tile.
- **measured:** `ownerd.py:193-195` drops the head of the tail at a byte offset
  (`del tail[: len(tail) - self.tail_bytes]`), which is wherever 64 KiB happens to land. Asked
  of the live owner over its own socket, all 12 attached terminals:

  ```
  all 12 attached terminals:  tail_bytes = 65536, tail_truncated = True
  terminal A   head = b'[1B        \xe2\x94\x82 assis'   <- ESC gone, xterm prints "[1B"
  terminal B   head = b'1m2. A csatolm\xc3\xa1ny \xe2'     <- ESC[ gone, prints "1m2."
  terminal C   contains \x1b[55;1H — the exact sequence in the screenshot
  first ESC after the cut:  0-66 bytes away, mean 14.5, one ESC per 8-18 bytes
  ```

  Terminal C is the one in the report. The cut had landed between its `\x1b[` and its
  `55;1H`, so the cursor never moved and the parameters were drawn as text.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** the replay is honest about being truncated
  (`replay_truncated`), so the missing HEAD is a stated fact — but a decapitated escape
  sequence is not a missing screen, it is a WRONG one: the cursor stays where it was, the
  following output lands in the wrong place, and the tile looks broken rather than partial.
  It is distinct from B-16 and B-76, which are about a screen that is stale; this one is
  about a screen that was never well-formed. Resizing repairs it because the program repaints
  from scratch, which is why it *"always"* works and why nothing else does.
- **fixed when:** after a drop, the retained buffer begins at a sequence boundary. Measured
  cost of resynchronising forward to the first `ESC`: **at most 66 bytes** across the 12 live
  tails (mean 14.5, of 65 536 — under 0.1 %), so this is paid for. The check that goes from
  red to green: a unit test feeding a stream whose cut lands inside `ESC[55;1H` and asserting
  the replay does not begin with `55;1H`; and, live, none of the attached tails beginning
  with a decapitated sequence.

### B-81 — local absolute paths reach this public repository, and `set-leakscan` does not look for them

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-26 by this session, while running the pre-push scan on a 20-commit range
- **measured:**

  ```
  set-leakscan                                    → clean (77 files, 11 consumer patterns)
  git grep -l "/home/<user>"                      → 2 tracked files
  git log <upstream> --format='%s%n%b' | grep -c  → 8 already-PUSHED commit messages
  ```

  So the scan passes while the local username and directory layout are already published —
  in the tree and in history. One further occurrence was caught by hand in an unpushed
  commit message and left alone (rewriting it would remove nothing that is not already out,
  and would rewrite another session's commits in a shared checkout).
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** `release-safety.md` lists absolute local paths
  as check 4, and the tool that replaced the hand-run recipe does not implement it. A green
  scan therefore reads as "checked", which is the fail direction that makes a gate worse than
  none. The leak itself is mild — a username and a layout — but the pattern is the one the
  rule exists for.
- **fixed when:** `set-leakscan --list-patterns` names a `/home/<user>/` pattern; a staged
  file containing an absolute home path makes `set-leakscan --staged` exit non-zero; and the
  two tracked files are rewritten to relative or `<repo-root>`-prefixed paths. The already-
  pushed history is NOT in scope — scrubbing it is cleanup, not remediation, and it is a
  username, not a credential.

### B-79 — `set-web dashboard running at …:7400` is printed 66–82 s before anything listens on that port

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-26 by this session, while trying to verify a UI change on the running dashboard
- **measured:** `lib/set_orch/cli.py:838` prints the line, and `server.run()` — which binds the
  socket — is at `lib/set_orch/cli.py:880`. Between them sits the whole lifespan startup (42
  projects, their watchers and detectors). Timed on the live service:

  ```
  11:25:26  systemd: Started SET Web Dashboard
  11:25:29  set-web dashboard running at http://0.0.0.0:7400
  11:26:51  port 7400 actually LISTENING   (82 s after the line, 85 s after start)
  ```

  During that window `curl` gets `Connection refused`, `ss -ltn` shows no socket, and
  `systemctl is-active` says `active`. The main thread sits in `futex_wait_queue`.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** the line is a **claim, not a measurement** — it is
  printed before the act it describes, so it is false for the entire window and there is nothing
  in the journal to correct it (`Uvicorn running on …` never reaches the journal at all —
  `journalctl --user -u set-web --since -7d | grep -c "Uvicorn running"` → **0**). An operator
  reading the log sees a healthy start and a dead port, which reads as a crash. It cost this
  session two restarts and about five minutes of diagnosis, and one of those restarts was a
  second 91-second outage of the user's dashboard.
- **fixed when:** the line is printed from a uvicorn startup callback — after the socket is
  bound — or replaced with two lines, *starting* before and *listening on* after, and uvicorn's
  own startup log reaches the journal. Held by a test that asserts the "running at" string is not
  emitted before the port accepts a connection.

### B-73 — a CRASHED leakscan is reported to the operator as "this push would publish content that must not leave"

- **state:** open — the crash itself is fixed (`c3fdb91d`); the hook's wrong REASON is not
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, while trying to push
- **measured:** `set-leakscan` died with `FileNotFoundError: 'gh'` (an optional tool, absent on
  this machine). `bin/set-hook-leakscan:106` branches on `returncode == 0` alone, so the
  non-zero *crash* took the same path as a real finding and printed:

  ```
  BLOCKED by set-hook-leakscan — this push would publish content that must
  not leave the repository (repository: …)
  <the Python traceback>
  ```

- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** the *blocking* is right — a gate that cannot run
  must not report clean, and the hook's own comment says so. The *sentence* is false: nothing
  was found, and the operator is sent to hunt a leak that does not exist. The traceback is
  printed underneath, so it is recoverable — but only by a reader who distrusts the headline.
  This is the false-value class: a claim the system no longer has evidence for, stated in the
  alarming direction next to the real reason.
- **fixed when:** a non-zero exit that produced no findings is reported as *"the scan could not
  run"* with the tool's stderr, and is distinguishable from *"the scan found something"* — both
  still exit 2. Held by a test that stubs `set-leakscan` to exit non-zero with a traceback on
  stderr and asserts the hook's message does NOT claim content would be published, alongside
  the positive control that a real finding still does.

### B-74 — two consumer project names are already PUBLIC in this repository's history

- **state:** open — the working tree is scrubbed (`35a12993`); the history is not
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, on the first push after the registry was populated
- **measured:** `set-leakscan` on the push range flagged
  `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-24-projects-live-session-view/proposal.md:16`, which named
  two consumer projects in a parenthesis. `git log --oneline github/main -- <that file>` puts
  the content in **`cb1bad62`**, pushed to the PUBLIC GitHub repository the same day. So the
  scrub commit removes it from the tree and from nothing else.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** the same B-72 mechanism with the timing reversed
  — the text was written while the registry was empty, so no gate could have caught it, and it
  became a finding only once the names were registered. Two lines above it the same paragraph
  says *"a consumer project"* correctly, which is the tell: this was a slipped enumeration, not
  a misunderstanding, and enumerations are exactly what a name-based scanner exists for.
- **fixed when:** the user decides. Removing it means rewriting published history on a public
  repository, which also invalidates the clone on the other machine — that is their call, not a
  session's. `release-safety.md` has the procedure and its traps (the backup tag gets rewritten
  too). Until then this entry is the record that the exposure is known and deliberate.

### B-75 — `CLAUDE.md` sends every new session to a file that does not exist

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, looking for the web build command
- **measured:** `CLAUDE.md:472` — *"See [START.md](START.md) for application startup commands
  (install, dev server, database, tests)"*. `ls START.md` → `No such file or directory`.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** it fails by sending a reader somewhere empty at
  the exact moment they need the answer, and the instructions it promises are not trivial ones
  — this repo's web build needs a Node the system default is too old for (`v18.19.1` here;
  the tooling needs the nvm `v24.15.0`), and `pnpm test:unit` aborts on an unapproved esbuild
  build script. A session that guesses instead gets `npx` pulling an unrelated vitest, which is
  what happened here.
- **fixed when:** either `START.md` exists and names the interpreter and the package manager,
  or the reference is removed from `CLAUDE.md`. Held by nothing automated today; the cheap
  check is that every relative link in `CLAUDE.md` resolves to a file that exists.

### B-72 — the leakscan's consumer-name check was passing on an EMPTY pattern list, and a leak was already in the tree

- **state:** partly closed — one of four findings is scrubbed (this file); three remain
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, the moment the registry stopped being empty
- **measured:** `set-leakscan` resolves its consumer-name list at run time from
  `~/.config/set-core/projects.json`. That file held `{"default":null,"projects":{}}` and had
  not been written since May, so the list was **empty** and every scan returned clean:

  ```
  before:  ✔ set-leakscan: clean (…, remote unknown)          # 0 consumer patterns
  after:   ✖ set-leakscan: 4 finding(s) in 5270 scanned file(s)
             consumer-name (3) [BLOCKS]        — 3 tracked files
             consumer-name:commit-message (1)  — 1 commit in history
  ```

  Nothing about the repository changed between the two runs. The only change was that
  eight projects were registered, which is what gives the scanner its patterns.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** it fails **clean**, which is the one direction
  a leak scanner must never fail in. A green scan on an empty pattern list is
  indistinguishable from a green scan on a real one — no count was printed, no warning that
  the list was empty, and this repository is public. `release-safety.md` already states the
  general form of this — *"a check whose input list has to be reconstructed by hand is a
  check that never runs"* — and this is that sentence with the manual step automated and the
  list still empty. The `set-hook-leakscan` PreToolUse gate and the `pre-push` hook both
  inherit the blindness, so BOTH gates were passing everything.
- **fixed when:** two things, and the first is the one that generalises:
  1. a scan with **zero** consumer patterns does not report `clean` — it reports that it
     could not check (the same distinction the fleet draws between a gap and a zero). Held
     by a test that runs the scanner against an empty registry and asserts a non-clean,
     non-blocking "unmeasured" verdict, with the positive control that a populated registry
     still reports clean on a clean tree.
  2. the three remaining tracked findings are scrubbed and the commit message is rewritten,
     verified by `set-leakscan --tree` returning clean with a non-zero pattern count.

### B-71 — `set-project init --dry-run` WRITES the project registry, and can silently change the default project

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, on the first dry-run of the day — the run was a
  preview taken precisely because the rule book requires one before touching a project tree
- **measured:** the registry was empty and untouched since May:

  ```
  $ cat ~/.config/set-core/projects.json
  {"default":null,"projects":{}}
  $ stat -c '%y' ~/.config/set-core/projects.json
  2026-05-14 17:33 …
  ```

  One `set-project init --dry-run`, run inside a project directory, later:

  ```
  $ cat ~/.config/set-core/projects.json
  {"default": "<project>", "projects": {"<project>": {"path": "…", "addedAt": "2026-08-24T12:16:54Z"}}}
  ```

  The write is `bin/set-project:975-985` — the `jq '.projects[$name] = …'` block and the
  `json_set "$CONFIG_FILE" ".default"` that follows it. Neither is inside a `DRY_RUN` guard,
  while every write into the project tree below them is. The tree itself was clean
  afterwards (`git status --porcelain` unchanged), which is what makes this hard to see.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** it fails by mutating state a preview promised
  not to mutate, and the second write is worse than the first — registering a project is at
  least what `init` is for, but **setting it as the DEFAULT** changes which project every
  other tool operates on when none is named. A user previewing a deploy has no reason to
  expect either.

  It also invalidates a completeness claim already written down. `CLAUDE.md` records the
  dry-run as *"proven not to write in preview"*, on the evidence of a sha256 snapshot of
  **2477 files any deploy path can reach**, before and after, zero bytes changed. That
  snapshot covers the project tree. The registry is outside it, so the measurement was
  structurally blind to the one write that happened — a proxy measured instead of the thing,
  and the proxy said what the reader wanted to hear.
- **fixed when:** a `--dry-run` init prints `Would register '<name>'` and
  `Would set '<name>' as the default project`, and `~/.config/set-core/projects.json` is
  byte-identical before and after. Held by a test that snapshots the registry file's sha256
  around a dry-run init of an unregistered repo and asserts equality — with the positive
  control that a real init of the same repo does change it.

### B-77 — a lazy chunk that a redeploy removed leaves `loading the editor…` on screen for ever

- **state:** closed (`133a1e1c`) for the file view; **the same shape is still open at four other lazy
  imports** — see *what is NOT fixed* below. Numbered after checking `origin/main` as well as
  the local file, which is the lesson B-76 carries.
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by the user — *"hiba file betöltéskor fleet file editor nézeten"* —
  with a screenshot whose devtools panel is the actual evidence, and that is the tell: a
  reader who has to open devtools to learn that nothing is loading is looking at a screen
  that is lying calmly.
- **measured:** four console lines, of which the third names the mechanism:

  ```
  GET /assets/index-C41P94E2.js        404 (Not Found)
  GET /assets/monacoLocal-DhsFH-Aq.js  404 (Not Found)
  Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module:
      http://localhost:7400/assets/index-C41P94E2.js
  ```

  The page was running `index-DIYHZ1ow.js`, a build that had been replaced twice while the
  tab stayed open. Vite hashes every chunk by content, so a redeploy deletes the exact
  filenames the running page knows; `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'` against all four
  confirmed 404 for each. `FleetFileView.tsx:149` awaited `Promise.all([import(…), import(…)])`
  with **no catch**, so the rejection escaped as an unhandled promise, `ready` stayed `false`,
  and the `ready ? <Editor/> : loading the editor…` ternary rendered the second branch for ever.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** in the silent direction, and on a screen with no
  other symptom — the tree lists fine, the file name is in the header, the panel simply never
  fills. The reader cannot tell it apart from a slow load. It is also self-inflicted at exactly
  the wrong moment: the redeploy that breaks the open tab is the one that carries the fix the
  reader was waiting for.
- **fixed:** the import is caught, and the message is a MEASUREMENT rather than a guess.
  Printing *"the dashboard was updated — reload"* on any chunk failure would be wrong: the same
  rejection is what an offline tab or a dead server produces, and a reload cannot help there.
  So `web/src/lib/buildFreshness.ts` fetches `/index.html` with `cache: 'no-store'` and asks
  whether it still names **this** page's entry script. Only a `false` licenses the word
  *updated* and the reload control; everything else — including *cannot be answered* — shows
  the underlying error with no button.
- **fixed when:** `web/tests/unit/buildFreshness.test.ts` (9) and
  `web/tests/unit/fleetFileViewEditorFailure.test.tsx` (3). Both directions are held: a served
  page that STILL names this build must not be reported as a redeploy, and an unrelated error
  must not even cost a round trip. Mutation-proven — dropping the `setEditorFailure` call turns
  all three surface tests red. 940 web tests green, `tsc -b` clean.
- **and it was LOOKED at** — `ui-quality.md`, 2026-08-24, by reproducing the redeploy rather
  than by mocking it: a tab was opened on the served build, the monaco chunk was renamed and
  `index.html` repointed at a different entry (a real 404 plus a real entry mismatch), then a
  file was clicked in that tab. The panel read *"the editor could not be loaded — the dashboard
  was updated while this page was open, so the part it just asked for is no longer on the
  server — reload the page"* with a `reload` control. `dist` was restored afterwards and every
  asset `index.html` names verified 200.
- ⚠ **what is NOT fixed, stated so a green suite does not imply it.** The same unguarded shape
  is at four more lazy imports: `FleetTerminal.tsx:248-252` (xterm — the most-used surface on
  this screen), `VoiceInput.tsx:57`, `Dashboard.tsx:18` (`lazy(() => import(…))`) and the graph
  panel behind it. Each fails the same silent way after a redeploy. `classifyLoadFailure` is
  written to be reused; wiring it is a task, not a redesign.

### B-76 — a re-attached terminal is never asked to repaint, so the status footer comes back partial

- ⚠ **renumbered 2026-08-24 from B-71, which a PARALLEL SESSION had already taken.** Rule 3
  says allocate by measuring the file, and that was done — `grep … | tail -1` on the local
  file said B-69. It was still wrong: another session held B-71 and B-72 in its own working
  tree and pushed them (`15b28571`) while this entry was being written. **Measuring a file
  measures one checkout, not the register**, and on a repository with parallel sessions those
  are different things. `git fetch && grep` on `origin/main` before allocating is the check
  that would have caught it; it costs one round trip. The commits below (`e07c2ad1`,
  `6ee3b348`) name this entry as B-71 in their subject and body.
- **state:** closed (`e07c2ad1`) — fix, tests and the visual check below
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by the user, with a screenshot, switching between agent tabs on
  the fleet screen: *"ha valtas van agentek kozott akkor a render alul hianyosan renereli a
  status footert, de ha ujrarajzoltatom layout change miatt (elhuzom a layout hatart) akkor
  megjavul"* — and their own diagnosis, which was right: *"agent valtaskor ki kellene adni
  egy repaintet"*.
- **measured:** three places, and it is the third that closes the argument.
  - `lib/set_orch/fleet/ownerd.py:494` — the replay is `bytes(self._tails[label])`, a RING
    buffer, and the ack carries `replay_truncated` precisely because it can begin
    mid-stream. A tail that starts mid-stream is missing the cursor moves and erases that
    composed the screen before it, so what renders is honestly incomplete — and what goes
    missing is what was drawn last and least often: the bottom row.
  - `lib/set_orch/fleet/owner.py:406` — a resize is one `TIOCSWINSZ` and nothing else. Linux
    `tty_do_resize` compares the struct and returns BEFORE signalling when it is unchanged,
    so no `SIGWINCH` reaches the program and nothing repaints.
  - `web/src/components/FleetTerminal.tsx` — the B-16 comment ends *"if it matches there is
    nothing to repaint and nothing is stale"*. The first clause is true; the second does not
    follow, and it is the assumption the whole defect sits on. A tab switch is exactly the
    matching case: same tile, same box, same geometry — so `sendSize()` sent a size that
    changed nothing, and the truncated replay stayed on screen.
- **why the earlier fix did not cover it:** B-16 repaired the *order* of the two geometries,
  which is what makes the replay render at the width it was composed for. It cannot repair a
  replay that is INCOMPLETE, and it deliberately does nothing when the two geometries agree.
  Two defects on the same seam, and the first one's fix is what made the second visible.
- **fixed:** `settle()` now sends one row less immediately before the real size, so the
  second write always differs from the first and the program gets a `SIGWINCH` whether or not
  it processed the first. Unconditional rather than gated on `replay_truncated`: an
  unnecessary repaint costs a flicker nobody sees, a skipped one costs the defect back,
  silently, still looking like a terminal.
- **fixed when:** `tests/unit/fleetTerminalReplayGeometry.test.tsx` — *asks the program to
  repaint even when its size did not change* asserts the PAIR and its order, and *does not
  nudge a terminal that has no row to spare* holds the one-row floor. Mutation-proven:
  removing the `nudge()` call turns 6 of the 12 tests in that file red (measured 2026-08-24),
  so nothing there passes either way. **The visual half is DONE** — `ui-quality.md`, 2026-08-24 on the running
  dashboard at `http://localhost:7400/fleet`, nine agents as tabs: a busy agent's terminal
  was opened, another tab selected, then this one again. Both footer rows came back whole
  (`[web] web (main) | Opus 5 … | Ctx: 14 %` and the permissions row), and the context
  counter had MOVED across the switch — 141509 → 143660 tokens. That second number is what
  makes it a repaint rather than a lucky replay: a stale screen cannot show a newer number.

### B-69 — renaming a held agent kills the drain on its terminal, silently and then fatally
- **state:** open — the code is fixed and COMMITTED (`3411d907`), the running daemon is not.
  Re-measured 2026-08-24, and this is why the entry stays open rather than closing on the
  commit: `systemctl --user show set-agent-owner -p ExecMainStartTimestamp` says
  **Sat 2026-08-22 10:54:11 CEST**, while `3411d907` was authored 2026-08-23 16:22:27. A
  long-lived service holds the code it started with, so the defect is live right now on this
  machine. Closing it on the commit alone would have been the shipped-commit-is-not-a-
  running-system error, in the reassuring direction.
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by the user — renamed a terminal on the fleet screen and
  *"since then I cannot type into it"*
- **measured:** `journalctl --user -u set-agent-owner`, six seconds apart:

  ```
  16:12:28  fleet owner: renamed <old> to <new> (unit set-agent-<old>.scope, pid … — unchanged)
  16:12:34  fleet owner: terminal of <old> reached EOF after 0 bytes
  ```

  Nothing had ended. `OwnerDaemon._attach_drain` installed the pty reader as
  `loop.add_reader(fd, self._drain, agent.label, fd)`, so the label was baked in at
  start; `AgentOwner.rename` re-keys the map, so the next read asked for a name nobody
  held, `owner.read` raised `OwnerError`, `_drain` caught it as an empty read — and an
  empty read is EOF, so it called `_detach_drain(fd)`. Behavioural proof against
  `HEAD` vs the fix, same input, a rename between the attach and the read:
  `detached: [7] | tail: b''` → `detached: [] | tail: b'after the rename'`.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** twice in the reassuring direction. The
  terminal goes SILENT rather than broken — keystrokes still reach the pty (`write` is
  by label and the new label resolves), they simply never echo, so it reads to the
  person as *I cannot type into it*. And an undrained pty fills after about a
  screenful, at which point the agent process BLOCKS on its own output: a rename whose
  entire promise is *the process is untouched* eventually stops it. `_rekey` moved
  every label-keyed store and looked complete; the reader in the event loop is not a
  store, which is the same shape as the fifth write path that was not a file.
- **fixed when:** `_drain` takes the fd only and asks `AgentOwner.label_for_fd(fd)`
  each time, and an `OwnerError` is no longer reported as EOF —
  `tests/unit/test_fleet_ownerd.py::test_a_rename_does_not_end_the_drain`. **Live only
  after `systemctl --user restart set-agent-owner`,** which drops every pty master this
  owner holds: the agents keep running in their scopes but become orphans, and each one
  costs a `recover` (stop + `--resume`) to get its terminal back. Until that restart,
  do not rename a terminal.

### B-70 — the leakscan hook blocks a LOCAL `git tag`, which is the safety net the scrub procedure requires

- ⚠ **renumbered 2026-08-24 from B-69, which was already taken.** Two entries carried
  that number for a day — the register's own rule 3, broken again — and BOTH are cited in
  commit messages: the rename defect above in `3411d907`'s body, this one in `c75706b0`'s
  subject (`bugs(B-69): a leakscan-hook …`). The earlier-written entry keeps the number, so
  that commit subject names this entry under its old handle and nothing else does.
- **state:** closed (`6ee3b348`) — `bin/set-hook-leakscan` now matches `push` only.
  ⚠ `c75706b0` (*"bugs(B-69): a leakscan-hook …"*) is the entry, NOT the fix: it touched one
  file, `openspec/bugs/README.md`, +25 lines. A commit subject in the form of a fix is one
  of the two places a defect is claimed done, and here the diff said otherwise —
  `git show --stat` cost seconds and is the only thing that separated them.
- **reported:** 2026-08-24 by this session, while clearing the 25 findings that were
  blocking a 112-commit push
- **measured:** `bin/set-hook-leakscan:29` — `PUBLISH_RX` is
  `git\s+(?:-[^\s]+\s+|--[^\s]+\s+)*(?:push|tag)(?:\s|$)`, so it fires on any `git tag`.
  The blocked command was `git tag leakscan-backup-20260824 HEAD && … && git filter-branch
  --msg-filter …` — a purely local backup tag followed by the message rewrite that FIXES the
  findings. Re-running the `filter-branch` half alone passed, which isolates the trigger to
  the `git tag`.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** it fails in the blocking direction, which is
  the safe one for leaks and the wrong one here — it stands in front of the repair. A local
  tag publishes nothing; only `git push --tags` (or an explicit refspec) does, and that form
  is already caught by the `push` half. Worse, `.claude/rules/release-safety.md` tells the
  operator to take a backup tag before a history rewrite, so the gate blocks the exact step
  its own rule book prescribes — and the gate's message says not to work around it. A guard
  that refuses the documented repair is how a guard earns its way into `--no-verify`, which
  is the failure mode the leakscan's own phone-number docstring already names.
- **fixed:** `tag` is gone from `PUBLISH_RX`; a tag reaches a remote only through a push
  (`--tags`, `<remote> <tag>`, `refs/tags/…`) and every one of those forms is caught by the
  `push` half — the narrowing removes a false block and opens no hole, which is the only
  shape of narrowing a safety gate may take.
- **fixed when:** `tests/unit/test_leakscan.py::…::test_a_local_tag_is_not_a_publication_
  either` (a `git tag` in the DIRTY repository passes — a clean one would pass for the wrong
  reason and stay green with `tag` still in the pattern) and
  `test_but_pushing_tags_to_a_remote_still_is` (three push forms still blocked). Both green,
  22 in the file; mutation-proven — putting `tag` back turns the first one red.

### B-68 — a review finding's `line` is rendered with an `L` prefix whatever it holds, so prose becomes a line number
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by this session, during the required visual check of
  `findings-path-resolvable` on the Learnings screen
- **measured:** dashboard, Learnings tab of a registered project, a HIGH finding rendered
  as `File: /home/.../tests/unit/target.test.ts L(file does not exist)`. The stored value
  is prose the reviewer put on the `LINE:` line, and `web/src/components/LearningsPanel.tsx`
  renders `L{issue.line}` unconditionally. `_parse_review_issues`
  (`lib/set_orch/verifier.py`) takes whatever follows `LINE:` verbatim, with no shape check.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** it reads as a location. `L(file does not
  exist)` is a claim about *where* the finding is, made out of a sentence about *whether the
  file exists at all* — and the reassuring direction, because a reader who scrolls past it
  sees a finding that looks located.
- **fixed when:** a `line` that is not a line reference is not rendered as one — either the
  parser rejects a non-numeric `LINE:` value at the point it is stored, or the row renders
  the prefix only for a numeric value. Held by a test that feeds `line: "(file does not
  exist)"` through the row and asserts the `L` prefix is absent.

### B-67 — the restore control runs on the first click, next to `+ start an agent`, and its count is the blast radius
- **state:** fixed in the surface (`<sha>` — this commit); the spec delta is still open
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by the user, with a screenshot — *"és hiba túl közel van a
  restore gomb és krédezzen rá!!!!!"*
- **measured:** live, on this machine, twice in one hour:
  - the user mis-clicked the control and **21 agents started** on `consumer-app`
    (`journalctl --user -u set-web`: `10:44:02`–`10:44:24`, *"20 started, 15 skipped"*
    then *"1 started, 50 skipped"*), plus 3 on `set-core` at `10:43:51`. Nothing undid
    them except stopping each one by hand.
  - the screenshot shows why: `+ start an agent` and
    `⟳ Restore 21 of 53 — 2 already running, 30 cannot be resumed` sit in the SAME
    header row, a few pixels apart. One is additive and cheap; the other starts
    twenty-one processes that immediately begin reading context.
  - the same shape hit this session minutes earlier: an Enter keypress submitted the
    start form and started an agent nobody asked for.
- **fixed when:** the control asks before acting, naming the count and the project, and
  a first click sends NOTHING to the server. Held by
  `web/tests/unit/fleetRestoreSurface.test.tsx` — the assertion is the absence of a
  POST, not the presence of a dialog, because a confirmation that is drawn but not
  obeyed looks identical from the outside. Mutation-checked: reverting to the
  run-on-first-click behaviour fails 8 tests.
- **still open:** the `agent-fleet-restore` spec still describes a control that acts on
  a click, so this behaviour change needs its delta. Also unexamined: whether the same
  one-click exposure exists on `RestoreFromEmpty` and on the column indicator.

### B-66 — `set-list` presents a prunable worktree as a live one, and so does the Worktrees page
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by this session, while adding worktree selection to the fleet
  start form (`fleet-start-agent-in-worktree`).
- **measured:** in this repository, same moment:
  - `git worktree list --porcelain` returns **four** entries, and **three** carry
    `prunable gitdir file points to non-existent location` — their directories no
    longer exist.
  - `set-list` prints all four under "Worktrees for ..." with a `Path:` line each,
    with nothing distinguishing the three that are gone.
  - the dashboard's Worktrees page reads `_list_worktrees`, which parsed the
    `worktree`, `HEAD`, `branch` and `bare` lines and **dropped `prunable`** — so a
    vanished worktree parsed identically to a live one.
- **fixed when:** `set-list` marks or omits a prunable entry, and the Worktrees page
  shows it as prunable rather than as live. The parser half is already done
  (`_list_worktrees` now carries `prunable` and `is_main`, with
  `tests/unit/test_worktree_locations.py` holding it); what is open is the two
  surfaces that still render every entry the same way.
- **note:** the fleet start form and its guard already refuse prunable locations, so
  the *startable* path is covered. This entry is about the two surfaces that only
  DISPLAY — which is the false-value class: a value the system no longer stands
  behind, shown next to ones it does.

### B-60 — nothing can be copied out of a terminal: there is no clipboard path, and mouse tracking eats the selection
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by the user — *"copy-pase mintha nem mene a terminal
  ablakokban most"*.
- **measured:** live fleet screen, the `set-core-bugfix2` terminal, in the browser:
  - the xterm element's class list is `terminal xterm xterm-dom-renderer-owner-1
    **enable-mouse-events** focus` — the agent's TUI turned mouse tracking on, so a
    plain drag goes to the agent instead of selecting. After a plain drag
    `.xterm-selection` has 0 children and `window.getSelection()` is empty.
  - with **Shift** the selection does happen: after a shift+triple-click the helper
    textarea holds the line and reports `selectionStart=0 selectionEnd=90`, and the
    highlight is visible on screen. So selection is not broken — the ROUTE into and
    out of it is missing.
  - no clipboard addon is installed: `web/package.json` carries `@xterm/addon-fit`
    and `@xterm/addon-web-links` only.
  - `FleetTerminal.tsx` attaches no `attachCustomKeyEventHandler`, so Ctrl+C goes
    through the core — `evaluateKeyboardEvent` → `triggerDataEvent` →
    `preventDefault` — which means it **sends SIGINT and does not copy**. And every
    keystroke clears the selection anyway: in the bundle,
    `this._coreService.onUserInput((()=>{this.hasSelection&&this.clearSelection()}))`.
- ~~**the half that was never broken:** PASTE works and always did.~~ **WRONG, and
  corrected 2026-08-22 the same evening — see B-62.** That measurement delivered a
  synthetic `paste` event, which is a power the harness has and the reader does not.
  A real `Ctrl+V` never pastes: the core sends `\x16` to the pty and calls
  `preventDefault`, so the browser's own paste never starts. Measured with a page
  `keydown`+`paste` probe: `Ctrl+V` → `defaultPrevented: true`, **zero** paste
  events. The half declared safe was the half that was broken, and the wrong claim
  is kept here rather than erased because the DEFECT CLASS is the durable part:
  driving a thing with an API the user does not have measures a different system.
- **fixed when:** after a selection, one documented key (Ctrl+Shift+C) or the
  header's copy control puts the selected text on the clipboard with nothing
  reaching the pty, and the screen SAYS that selecting needs Shift while the agent
  has mouse tracking on.
- **shipped, and what is verified — `76f95def`, partial:** the copy control, the
  Ctrl+Shift+C key, the amber "the agent is reading the mouse" icon and the
  outcome notice are all on screen (LOOKED at, 1517 px), and the control reports
  honestly with nothing selected — `not copied: nothing is selected — hold Shift
  and drag over the text first`. What is **NOT** verified is the copy of a REAL
  selection: browser automation cannot make one. Measured — a synthetic
  shift+drag leaves `.xterm-selection` empty (`had:0` immediately after the drag),
  while a hand-drag paints a highlight. The harness has different powers than the
  hand here, so the last step needs a person: select with Shift held, press
  Ctrl+Shift+C, paste elsewhere. The entry stays open until somebody has.

### B-65 — the panel was doing the copy itself; the browser was going to do it
- **state:** open (fix shipped, browser confirmation outstanding)
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by the user, third round — *"beillesztés szöveg ment copy még nem"*,
  and then the observation that redirected the whole thing: *"semmi nem jelenik meg es ha eger
  jobb gomb akkor is eltunik a kijeloles de nem masolja"*.
- **why that one sentence is the finding:** the MOUSE fails the same way. Two rounds had been
  spent treating this as a keyboard problem — B-60 picked a key Chrome had already claimed,
  B-64 replaced the clipboard call with a synchronous one. A path that fails for the key AND
  for the right button is not about keys and not about which clipboard API is called. It is
  the panel performing work the browser was going to perform.
- **the cause, and it was in our own fix:** the handler cleared the selection SYNCHRONOUSLY,
  in the keydown, on the reasoning that copying should leave the interrupt one keystroke away.
  Correct about the goal, wrong about the mechanism — the browser copies the selection that
  exists when the event finishes, so clearing it in the handler destroys the very thing being
  copied. Both clipboard APIs were then the only remaining path, and both are refused or hang
  wherever the browser does not consider the document eligible.
- **the fix, and it is the same shape that made paste work:** decline the keystroke and get
  out of the way. Nothing is cleared in the handler. A `copy` listener answers the browser's
  request for the data with the terminal's selection, which is what PROVES a copy happened —
  the announcement hangs off that event rather than off our own call, and it covers the
  context menu as well as the key. The selection is cleared one macrotask later, so the
  interrupt is still one keystroke away. If the browser never asks within 400 ms, the
  clipboard APIs run as a fallback and announce whatever they answer, so **silence is
  structurally impossible** — which is the property that failed in all three rounds.
- **measured:** 7 new tests, 5 of 5 mutants caught (synchronous clear restored, the data not
  set, the fallback firing after a successful copy, the fallback removed entirely, a copy
  event taken while nothing is selected). 852 web tests green, `npx tsc -b` silent.
  One existing test had to CHANGE rather than pass — it demanded the synchronous clear — and
  the reason is recorded in it rather than edited away.
- **NOT verified in a browser, and it cannot be from this session:** the MCP-driven tab is
  structurally `visibilityState: hidden`, where Chrome refuses `execCommand('copy')` outright
  (measured: returned `false`) and stalls `writeText` (measured: 4.7 s, no answer). Whether a
  reader's own visible tab copies is exactly the thing this session cannot press a key in.
- **fixed when:** the reader selects with Shift, presses Ctrl+C, and PASTES THE TEXT SOMEWHERE
  ELSE. A "copied N chars" notice is a claim about the mechanism; three rounds of this entry
  exist because the mechanism was not the thing that was broken.

### B-64 — copying said NOTHING and cleared the selection: the async clipboard write never answers
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by the user, testing the B-63 fix — *"tudod mi nem megy? ha innen
  ctrl-c"*, and then the detail that locates it exactly: *"1 és eltűnik a kijelölés"* — no
  message in the header at all, and the selection gone.
- **measured:** those two observations together leave one candidate, and that is why the
  report was worth more than a stack trace. **The selection vanishing proves the handler
  RAN** — `term.clearSelection()` is only called on the copy branch. **The silence proves
  the write never answered** — every settled outcome, success or refusal, renders a notice.
  So the fault is in `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, not in the key handling.
  Corroborating, from this session: the same call did not return in **4.7 s** from a tab
  whose `visibilityState` was `hidden` (`clipboard-write: granted`, `hasFocus: true`), and
  the B-60 commit had already recorded a **45 s** non-return. That measurement alone could
  not have decided it — a hidden tab is a documented reason for Chrome to stall — which is
  why the reader's observation is the evidence and mine is only the corroboration.
- **why the existing 2 s race did not save it:** it turns a hang into a *reported* failure,
  which is the right thing and still leaves the reader unable to copy. A guard that converts
  silence into a message is not a repair for the thing that was silent.
- **the fix, and its shape:** the SYNCHRONOUS `document.execCommand('copy')` runs FIRST,
  inside the keystroke's own transient activation; the async API stays only as a fallback.
  Order is the whole fix — a fallback that runs second cannot rescue a call that never
  settles. Focus is restored to whatever held it, because a copy that moved the keyboard out
  of the terminal would be its own defect.
- **fixed when:** the reader selects with Shift, presses Ctrl+C, and PASTES THE TEXT
  SOMEWHERE ELSE. Nothing short of the paste proves it — a header saying "copied" is a claim
  about the mechanism, and this whole entry exists because the mechanism reported nothing
  while the result was also absent.

### B-63 — the shipped copy key cannot be pressed in Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+C is the browser's own DevTools shortcut
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-23 by the user, testing the B-62 fix — *"beillesztes szoveg ment,
  copy terminalrol nem"* and, decisively, *"ctrl shift c pedig elohozza a debug windowt"*.
- **measured:** the reader's own observation is the measurement, and it is the one this
  session could not have made: `Ctrl+Shift+C` opens Chrome's DevTools element inspector.
  That shortcut is handled by the browser BEFORE the page sees the keystroke, so
  `attachCustomKeyEventHandler` — which is what B-60 relied on — never runs. The handler is
  correct; the key is unreachable.
- **what this says about B-60, and it is the durable half:** the copy path was verified by
  asserting that the DECISION function returns `true` for `Ctrl+Shift+C`, and by clicking the
  header's copy control. Both passed, and both were about the mechanism. Nothing in either
  check could see that the reader's finger never reaches the handler — the same class as
  driving a thing with an API the user does not have. **A keyboard shortcut is not verified
  until somebody presses it in the browser the reader uses.**
- **the paste half is CONFIRMED working** by the same round: *"beillesztes szoveg ment"*.
  B-62's text half is therefore verified by the reader, not only by this session.
- **the image half is absent as designed**, not regressed — see B-62 and the
  `terminal-image-paste` change.
- **fixed when:** the reader can copy a selection out of an agent terminal with a key Chrome
  does not claim, pressed in Chrome, with the copied text pasted somewhere else to prove it —
  and the interrupt is still reachable.

### B-62 — Ctrl+V does not paste into an agent terminal, and a clipboard IMAGE has no path at all
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by the user — *"ctrl-c és ctrl-v nem mukodik most agent
  terminalban. kepet sem tudo vagolaprol betenni. korabban mind mukodott"*. The
  "previously" is a native terminal emulator, not this panel: the panel has never
  had either path (see the correction on B-60).
- **measured:** live fleet screen, the `set-core-bugfix2` terminal, with a
  capture-phase `keydown` + `paste` probe installed on the document:

  | key | `keydown.defaultPrevented` | `paste` events |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Ctrl+V` | **true** | **0** |
  | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | false | 1 — `types: ["text/plain"]`, the text reaches the pty |

  The cause is in the emulator, not in this repo's code:
  `@xterm/xterm` 6.0.0, `lib/xterm.js` — `evaluateKeyboardEvent` maps a plain
  `Ctrl`+letter to `String.fromCharCode(keyCode-64)`, so `Ctrl+V` becomes `\x16`
  (SYN); `_keyDown` then runs `triggerDataEvent(key)` followed by
  `this.cancel(e,!0)` → `preventDefault()`. The browser's native paste is
  cancelled before it starts. `Ctrl+Shift+V` falls through with no `key`, so
  nothing is cancelled and xterm's own `paste` listener on the helper textarea
  does the work — which is why exactly one of the two works today.
- **the image half is a separate absence, not the same bug:** even the working
  `Ctrl+Shift+V` delivered `types: ["text/plain"]` only, and xterm's paste handler
  reads `clipboardData.getData("text/plain")` and nothing else. A clipboard image
  therefore cannot reach the pty by any key. The agent runs behind a pty on the
  server and has no access to the reader's browser clipboard, so this is a
  capability to be BUILT (accept `image/*` from the paste event, put the bytes
  where the agent can read them, type that path), not a regression to be undone.
  It is a new capability → OpenSpec, not a direct fix.
- **Ctrl+C is deliberate and stays deliberate:** it goes to the pty as SIGINT
  (B-60), copy is `Ctrl+Shift+C`. What the report shows is that the DECISION is
  invisible at the keyboard — the reader presses the key their other terminal
  uses and gets nothing they can see.
- **NOT measured, and it needs a human:** whether `Ctrl+Shift+C` actually reaches
  the clipboard for the reader. `navigator.clipboard.writeText` timed out at 3 s
  from this session — but the tab's `document.visibilityState` was `hidden`
  (`hasFocus: true`, `clipboard-write: granted`), which is a documented reason for
  Chrome to stall it. That is a fact about the measuring tab, not about the
  product, and it must not be written down as one.
- **fixed when:**
  1. `Ctrl+V` on a focused terminal fires exactly one `paste` event and the text
     appears in the agent's prompt — the same probe above going from
     `{defaultPrevented: true, paste: 0}` to `{defaultPrevented: false, paste: 1}`;
  2. and the header says which keys do what, so the Ctrl+C decision is legible
     where the reader is standing rather than only in this file.
- **shipped, and what is verified — `b4d7aa87`, PARTIAL:** the text half is done and
  measured end to end. The custom key handler now declines `Ctrl+V` and
  `Shift+Insert`, which is the whole repair, because xterm consults it before it
  cancels. On the same live terminal after the fix: `Ctrl+V` →
  `defaultPrevented: **false**`, **1** paste event, 17 chars, and the text appeared
  in the agent's prompt. Mutation-checked: removing the one line turns
  `fleetTerminalPasteKey.test.tsx` red, and the restore was grep-verified.
  **The entry stays OPEN for the image half** — that is a capability nobody has
  built, not a line to delete.

### B-61 — an agent tile's header eats 5-6 rows and leaves almost nothing for the content
- **state:** closed 2026-08-22 — LOOKED at on the same three agents (see *state after
  the fix* below: 38 px of header, 333 px of terminal). The entry stays here with its
  evidence; a deleted entry and one that was never written look the same.
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by the user, with a screenshot — *"a consumer-app 3
  agentjénél alig marad hely a terminal tartalmának mert tul sok helyet elvisz
  felette a heder … sztem 2 sor kellene egy layout/agent fejlécnek összesen"*.
- **measured:** three agent tiles in the screenshot, each carrying above its
  terminal: a title + icon row, a `says:` block of 2-3 lines, an `N file(s):` line,
  an **always-open** `send an instruction …` input row, and then a separate
  `terminal live ✂ >` row — 5-6 rows before the content, while the terminal itself
  gets about 10.
- **fixed when:** the tile header is at most 2 rows; the instruction box is CLOSED
  by default and opens on a control; the agent's own icons sit in the layout icon
  row rather than on a line of their own. Evidence: LOOKING at the same three
  agents, plus the header's measured height in rows.
- **state after the fix:** closed for the header itself — LOOKED at on the SAME
  three agents, 1517 px, two columns. The tile header is now **22 px of title row
  + 16 px of `says:` row = 38 px**, the instruction row measures **0**, and the
  terminal gets **333 px** on every one of the three. What made the rows:
  - the instruction box opens from a control in the title bar. Where an agent
    cannot be instructed at all there is no control and its one-line reason still
    stands where the box would be — otherwise the seat's absence would go unsaid
    and `↳ ?` elsewhere on the tile would be the only trace of it;
  - the focus takes ONE line with the whole sentence in its tooltip, and the file
    NAMES fold into a count on the same row (names in the tooltip). Enlarged, the
    names come back.
- **what was tried and REVERSED, because it crossed from compacting into
  hiding:** standing the whole `says:` block down while the terminal or the log is
  open. It reads well, and it is wrong: the declared focus comes from the
  messaging bus, the log does not carry it, so that row is the only place the fact
  exists. A unit test caught it, not the screen.
- **the icon question, asked and answered:** *"agent ikonjai miért nem épülnek be
  a layout ikonjai alá közvetlen"* was ambiguous, so it was put to the user with
  the two readings drawn out rather than guessed at. The answer — *"igen, egy
  sorba kerüljön a csempe ikonja és a layout ikon"*, resolved to: **the
  terminal's status row moves into the tile's title bar.** The tile had two icon
  rows for one agent, one directly under the other.
  - done with a **portal**, not by lifting state: phase, the attach
    acknowledgement and the copy outcome live in the terminal, and handing them
    to the tile would put a second copy of each somewhere that can disagree with
    the socket. Absent a slot the row still renders in place — a component that
    only draws its header when someone remembers to pass a slot would one day
    render headerless and say nothing.
  - **a defect the LOOKING found, and only the looking:** with the status row
    beside it the title bar's left half ran out of room and dropped `4m ·
    2657090` onto a line of its own — a merge made to save a row gave the row
    back, on exactly the narrow tiles it was meant to help. Fixed by letting that
    half truncate instead of wrap while a terminal shares the line.
  - **measured after, same three agents, three columns, 1517 px:** head 22 px +
    `says:` 16 px = **38 px**, a terminal row of its own measures **0**, and the
    terminal itself is **376 px** (333 before the merge). The cost, stated: the
    name and the branch truncate on a narrow tile — `consumer-app-atne…`, `quiet d…`
    — with the full text in the tooltip.
  - the portal is held by a test that fails without it (measured: removing
    `createPortal` turns it red; the restore was grep-verified).

### B-59 — in a three-column grid the terminal wraps to a few characters per line and stops being readable
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by this session, while looking at the fleet screen to
  confirm a rename — not what was being checked, which is why it is worth writing
  down rather than remembering.
- **measured:** LOOKED at, 1568 px viewport, three-column layout. Two tiles render
  their terminal one WORD per line: `gy / ulón / opsx:ff / hange, / s / zólj, / ogy
  / zt / egyem-e`. The prompt line beneath it is legible, so the pane is alive and
  relaying — it is the width that is wrong. A terminal is a fixed-grid device that
  assumes ~80 columns, which is roughly 560 px at this font; a third of 1568 px
  minus the chrome is well under half of that.
- **the shape, which this repo has already paid for once:** the same finding is
  recorded in `fleetDocks.defaultDockSize` — 320 px "was not a smaller terminal, it
  was a broken one". The docked case was fixed by measuring; the GRID case was not,
  so the defect came back through the other door. A per-axis default fixed one
  caller rather than the rule.
- **not caused by the rename work**, and it does not block it: the names, the
  pencil and the state lines all render correctly in the same screenshot.
- **fixed when:** a terminal pane never renders below the width its own emulator
  needs — either the column count refuses to squeeze a tile that holds an open
  terminal, or the terminal says it cannot be shown at this width instead of
  showing a column of syllables. The check is the screenshot: open a terminal in
  the three-column layout and read a line of it.

### B-58 — the durable stores fsync the FILE and not its directory, so a write can vanish in a reboot
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by this session, after a hand-made arrangement disappeared.
- **measured:** at 09:52 today `~/.local/share/set-core/fleet-layout.json` contained
  `docks: {"set-core": [{"kind": "agent", "id": "set-core-bugfix", "edge": "right"}]}`
  — read and quoted at the time. It now contains `docks: {}` and its mtime is
  **2026-08-21 23:30:12**, i.e. older than the reading. `last -x reboot` shows two
  further boots today at 10:52 and 10:53. So the version that carried the dock was
  written after 23:30 and is gone, along with its mtime — the shape of a lost
  rename rather than of an overwrite.
- **the mechanism, and it is in both stores:** `layout._write_atomically` and
  `roster._write_atomically` write a temp file, `fsync` the FILE, then `os.replace`.
  The rename itself is a directory operation, and the directory is never fsynced
  (`grep -n "fsync\|os.replace" lib/set_orch/fleet/{layout,roster}.py` → four lines,
  no `O_DIRECTORY` open anywhere). `os.replace` is atomic with respect to readers;
  it is NOT durable across an unclean shutdown until the parent directory's entry
  is flushed.
- **why it matters more than it looks:** these two files exist precisely to survive a
  reboot. The roster is what a restore reads, and it now carries the names a person
  put back by hand — the thing this whole change was for. A write that is atomic but
  not durable is the reassuring kind of wrong: every check passes, the file is
  complete and parsable, and the loss is invisible until someone remembers what was
  there.
- **fixed when:** both writers open the parent directory and `fsync` it after the
  replace. The check: write, then `debugfs`-free but sufficient — kill the machine
  with `echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger` on a scratch copy of the flow, or at minimum a
  unit test asserting the directory fd is fsynced (the mutation: remove the dir
  fsync and the test fails).

### B-56 — restore reports `started` for a session that has not resumed: it is sitting on a dialog nobody can see
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by the user, on two separate fleets — *"van ami
  visszajött de nem terminálban"* and *"consumer-app 6 agentje most állítottam
  vissza, ott egyiket sem tudom szerkeszteni"*.
- **measured:** LOOKED at, 2026-08-22. After a restore, `POST /api/fleet/roster/
  set-core/restore` answered `started: 7`, all `name_source: "restored"`, and
  `GET /api/fleet/agents` reported all 9 `population: "started-here"` with a
  terminal label — so by every check the framework performs, the fleet is back.
  Opening the terminal on `set-core-bb` shows what the process is actually
  doing: *"Resuming the full session will consume a substantial portion of the
  context limits. We recommend resuming from a summary. → 1. Resume from summary
  (recommended). Enter to confirm · Esc to cancel."* The conversation has NOT
  resumed; the process is blocked on a keystroke. Same on `set-core-e2`, and
  `bb`, `4f`, `33` all carry `dialog open` in their state line.
- **and what the tile shows instead:** with the terminal pane closed — which is
  how every tile comes back, because which panes are open is remembered per
  browser and keyed on the label — the tile renders the transcript and the
  sentence *"no input: this session has no seat on the messaging bus"* (B-48).
  So the one place that could take the keystroke is the one thing not on screen,
  and the sentence that IS on screen says, in effect, you cannot write here.
- **why it is not merely B-48 again:** the framework's own report is wrong in the
  reassuring direction. `started` is true of the PROCESS and false of the
  session, which is the mechanism-versus-result split: the check asks "did an
  agent start", the reader asks "is my conversation back". A restore of nine
  that leaves four blocked on an unanswered dialog reads as a complete restore.
- **measured constraint on the fix:** there is no flag that skips it —
  `claude --help` offers `--resume`, `--continue`, `--fork-session`, and nothing
  that pre-answers the summary prompt. And it should not be pre-answered blindly:
  summary-versus-full is a decision about the user's own context, and choosing it
  for them silently discards conversation they may want.
- **fixed when:** a restored agent whose terminal is waiting on a dialog is
  visible AS THAT on the tile — a state the reader can act on, with the terminal
  one click away — and the restore result stops calling such an entry plainly
  `started`. The check: restore a large session, and without opening any panel,
  the screen says it needs an answer.

### B-57 — a runtime roster was committed, and it carries consumer project names and home paths into a PUBLIC repo
- **state:** open — the file is out of the working tree and gitignored (this
  commit), but **it is still in local history** and must be scrubbed before the
  next push.
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by this session, while writing a handoff — noticed
  because the same mistake was about to be repeated with a second snapshot.
- **measured:** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-21-fleet-agent-restore/.roster-before-reboot.json`
  was added in `a7e5b5de` and re-touched by `7a6330a9`. Its `projects` keys are
  five consumer project names plus `/home/tg`, and 15 lines carry absolute home
  paths. `set-leakscan` classifies it `home-path (15) [BLOCKS]` and refuses the
  push, and `git branch -r --contains a7e5b5de` returns EMPTY — so nothing is
  published and the gate is doing its job. That is the only reason this is a
  defect and not an incident.
- **why it happened, which is the reusable half:** the artifact was deliberate
  and its intent was right — a snapshot of the roster taken before the reboot,
  as evidence. What was wrong is that the evidence was RAW RUNTIME DATA. The
  rule this repo already states is that set-core may read a consumer's data and
  must persist nothing derived from it; an evidence file is persistence, and it
  is the shape that feels exempt because it is "just a measurement".
- **fixed when:** `set-leakscan --tree` is clean, and `git log --all -- '*roster-before-reboot.json'`
  returns nothing. The scrub is a history rewrite (`git filter-branch --index-filter`)
  over the 95 unpushed commits — cheap while unpushed, and deliberately NOT done
  in the same breath as this entry: two other sessions are committing in this
  tree right now, and rewriting refs under them is how their work disappears.

### B-55 — eleven commit SHAs cited in the rule book and this register do not exist
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-22 by this session, while closing B-49..B-54 — the SHA it had just
  written was checked before being believed, and that check found the others.
- **measured:** every backtick-quoted short SHA in `openspec/bugs/README.md` was resolved
  with `git cat-file -e`. Eleven fail: `038c39e3`, `0b211f2f`, `28ef5ce7`, `387ba8c2`,
  `a2006254`, `ae9706bb`, `bf33e28e`, `c4f4842f`, `e2eb3dab`, `e52ccdc4`, `f64c7554`.
  `ae9706bb` is also cited in `CLAUDE.md`'s shipped-safety-track list. The commit it names
  exists — `git log --all` finds *"separate scaffold from knowledge with `once: true`"*
  dated 2026-07-24 — but under **two** different SHAs (`8e853fba`, `67bdabf2`), neither of
  them the cited one. Same subject, same timestamp, different hash: history was rewritten
  at least once before today and the references were never updated.
- **fixed when:** every SHA cited in the register and in CLAUDE.md resolves. Better: a check
  that fails when one does not, because this class is invisible — a dead SHA reads exactly
  like a live one until somebody types it.
- **⚠ what this session cannot rule out.** While repairing its own leak (a commit message
  carrying three consumer names, rewritten before anything was pushed), this session ran
  `git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all` and `git gc --prune=now --aggressive`.
  That destroys unreachable objects. The duplicate-SHA evidence above says these references
  were stale well before today — but if any of the eleven were unreachable-yet-still-in-the-
  reflog this morning, that gc removed the last handle to them, and **there is now no way to
  measure which**. Recorded as an unknown rather than argued away: the honest state is that
  the references are dead, the cause is probably an older rewrite, and the proof is gone.

### B-53 — the frustration detector inverts delight into anger, and the false label is then injected into later sessions
- **state:** closed (`259ab007` stopped the injection the same hour it was reported; `9f02e096` removed the detector)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by the user — *"feltételezem, hogy lehet ártott is valahol"* — and measured the same hour.
- **measured:** `set-memory recall "frustrated" --tags frustration` returns, verbatim:

  ```
  ⚠️ User frustrated (moderate): szuper!!! akkor inditsunk egy futast? ...
  ⚠️ User frustrated (moderate): pont igy akartam!!! akkor viszont ne reseteljunk ...
  ```

  Both are the user being **pleased**. The detector fires on exclamation marks, so
  enthusiasm is stored as anger (`_save_frustration_memory`,
  `lib/set_hooks/events.py:149,502`). It does not stop at storage: over 21 days of
  transcripts (4958 files under `~/.claude/projects`), 187 memory lines were injected
  into sessions and **168 of them (89.8 %) were these frustration records**. Their
  payloads are not knowledge at all — they are raw `<task-notification>` blocks,
  `<cross-session-message>` bodies, agent system prompts, and meeting-transcript
  fragments captured verbatim from whatever prompt was in flight.
  Exactly **one** line in 187 was a reusable project fact.
- **fixed when:** no memory is written with a sentiment label the prompt does not
  support, and no injected memory's body is a harness artifact. Note the harm
  direction: injecting `⚠️ User frustrated` into a fresh, unrelated session tells the
  model the user is angry when they were delighted, and hands it an out-of-context
  instruction as if it were remembered truth. This is worse than an empty injection.
- **also:** the same path persists meeting-transcript content — personal names,
  spoken business detail — into the memory store. That is the carrier
  [External Project Confidentiality](../../CLAUDE.md) names explicitly
  ("session-end extraction saves insights automatically"), and it is not hypothetical
  any more.

### B-54 — the useful citations all trace to the NATIVE file memory, none to shodh
- **state:** closed (the decision it supports is taken and recorded: openspec/changes/remove-shodh-memory, shipped) (evidence entry — it decides B-49..B-53's disposition)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by this session, after the user asked whether any read-back
  had ever been useful.
- **measured:** in one project's transcripts the agent cited remembered facts and acted
  on them — a named alert channel, a *fetch-before-allocating-an-id* rule, a pending
  deploy item. Each traces to a hand-written file in that project's native memory
  directory (`project_alerts-channel.md`, `feedback_bug-id-fetch-before-allocate.md`,
  `project_mcp-prod-deploy-pending.md`). Grepping the same three facts across the
  **120 shodh injection blocks** in that project's transcripts returns `0`, `0`, `0`.
  So the two systems ran side by side on the same project, and only one of them
  delivered anything a session used.
- **fixed when:** not a code fix — this entry closes when the decision it supports is
  taken and recorded: the native file memory becomes the framework's memory layer, and
  the shodh hooks stop writing.
- **caution on the method:** the first sweep of this measurement counted `From memory:`
  and reported 13 files. That string is in `CLAUDE.md`, hence in every transcript — the
  measurement was inside the corpus it measured. `rg` also reported `0` for a pattern
  `grep -a` found, because it treats these transcripts as binary. Both wrong answers
  came back clean and confident.

### B-49 — the ONLY memory-injection path in the default hook mode returns nothing, for every query
- **state:** closed (`259ab007` unbound the hooks; `9f02e096`+ removed the code — the proactive path no longer exists)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by this session, while auditing whether shodh-memory still earns its place.
- **measured:** `HOOK_MODE` defaults to `lite` (`lib/set_hooks/util.py:157`), and in
  `lite` every PostToolUse/Subagent handler bails at `if HOOK_MODE != "full"`
  (`lib/set_hooks/events.py:210,265,296,318`). That leaves `handle_user_prompt`
  (`events.py:118`) as the one path that can inject, and it feeds
  `proactive_context(query, limit=3)`. Measured on five unrelated queries:

  ```
  proactive=0 recall=3  <- 'fleet rename'
  proactive=0 recall=3  <- 'worktree merge gates'
  proactive=0 recall=3  <- 'e2e playwright gate'
  proactive=0 recall=3  <- 'consumer integration contract'
  proactive=0 recall=3  <- 'memory hook'
  ```

  `set-memory recall` returns relevant hits on the same store and the same words;
  `set-memory proactive` returns `count: 0` with `semantic_threshold: 0.45`. So the
  store is fine and the retrieval used for injection is not. The system's own meter
  agrees — `set-memory metrics` over 7 days: **empty injections 98.6 % (3718 of 3769)**,
  usage rate 0.0 %, 2 explicit citations, 8465 tokens injected across 328 sessions.
- **fixed when:** `set-memory proactive "<any query that recall answers>"` returns a
  non-zero count, and `set-memory metrics` shows the empty-injection rate falling below
  the recall path's. Note the fail direction: an empty injection is indistinguishable
  from "no relevant memory", so nothing has ever reported this.

### B-50 — `set-memory export` prints a valid EMPTY export and exits 0 when it fails
- **state:** closed (`9f02e096` — export is gone with the CLI; the defect was proven in both directions first: with the daemon stopped the same command returned 7885 records where it had returned 0)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by this session.
- **measured:** `set-memory export --output <f>` on a store whose own stats say
  `total_memories: 7864` produced
  `{"version":1,"format":"set-memory-export","count":0,"records":[]}`.
  The cause is the fallback on `lib/memory/core.sh:810` —
  `) || { echo '{...count:0,"records":[]}'; return 0; }` — which converts any failure
  into a well-formed empty backup. The failure itself is in
  `~/.local/share/set-core/memory/set-core/set-memory.log`:
  `RuntimeError: Failed to create memory system: Failed to open storage at ".../set-core"`,
  i.e. the export path opens RocksDB directly and loses the single-writer lock to the
  running daemon, so it can never succeed while the daemon is up.
- **fixed when:** export goes through the daemon like `list`/`recall` do, a failure exits
  non-zero instead of printing an empty document, and
  `set-memory export | jq .count` equals `set-memory stats | jq .total_memories`.
  This is the reassuring-empty class: the backup path cannot fail loudly, so a
  zero-record backup has looked like a successful one for an unknown length of time.

### B-51 — `set-memory list --limit N` silently returns `[]` for N ≥ 58
- **state:** closed (`9f02e096` — list is gone with the CLI)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by this session.
- **measured:** bisected on the live store —
  `limit=56 -> 56`, `limit=57 -> 57`, `limit=58 -> 0`, `limit=59 -> 0`,
  `limit=100 -> 0`, `limit=8000 -> 0`. Output at 57 is 135 839 bytes and at 56 is
  131 738, so the boundary tracks response SIZE, not count. Exit status is 0 and the
  body is a well-formed `[]`.
- **fixed when:** `set-memory list --limit 8000 | jq length` returns the store's real
  count. Consequence while open: the store cannot be enumerated or audited at all
  beyond 57 records, and the GUI browse dialog reads the same call.

### B-52 — the knowledge graph has been empty through 56 → 7864 memories, so two documented recall modes are placebo
- **state:** closed (`9f02e096` — the graph is gone with the store)
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by this session; first recorded 2026-02-16 in
  `docs/research/shodh-memory-audit.md` and unchanged since.
- **measured:** `set-memory graph-stats` today →
  `{"node_count": 0, "edge_count": 0, "avg_strength": 0.0, "potentiated_count": 0}`,
  with `set-memory stats` → `total_memories: 7864`. The February audit measured the
  same zeros at 56 memories, so 7808 further writes produced no node and no edge.
  `entities: []` on every record sampled (57 of 57), which is why: NER never runs on
  the CLI write path. Consequence: `--mode causal` and `--mode associative`, which the
  explore and apply skills pass, cannot differ from `--mode semantic` — the audit
  measured all five modes returning identical ids in identical order.
- **fixed when:** `graph-stats` reports a non-zero `node_count` after a `remember`, and
  the five modes stop returning identical result sets for the same query. Until then
  the honest repair is to stop passing the two modes rather than to keep documenting
  them.

### B-48 — a tile whose pty THIS framework holds says "no input", because the only way in it offers is the messaging bus
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by the user, after the restore — *"nem tudok a
  sessionökbe írni, mintha nem én nyitottam volna őket set- alól, hanem külső
  agent"*.
- **measured:** LOOKED at, 2026-08-21, tile `set-core-bb`: the header says
  `set-core-bb · waiting for an answer`, and where the input belongs it reads
  *"no input: this session has no seat on the messaging bus"*
  (`web/src/components/FleetInstruct.tsx:200`, reached when `instructable:false`
  and the terminal pane is closed). Yet `GET /api/fleet/agents` reports that same
  agent `population: "started-here", terminal_label: "set-core-bb"` — the
  framework holds its pty. Writing into it works: typed a character into
  `set-core-34`'s terminal from the browser and it arrived at the prompt. So the
  sentence is true about the bus and reads as a statement about the agent.
  6 of the 8 restored sessions have no seat (`sac agents --json` → only
  `set-core#039178b5` and `set-core#115270d4`, both re-enrolled at the restore
  minute), which is why it is the common case rather than an edge one.
- **fixed when:** a tile with a `terminal_label` never renders "no input". It
  names the way in that exists — open the terminal — and, per CLAUDE.md, offers
  ENROLMENT for the bus rather than staying silent about it. A tile with neither
  a seat nor a terminal keeps today's sentence.

### B-45 — the roster records the runtime's DERIVED name, so restore gives back the process and loses the name the user chose
- **state:** closed (`ad08ed86`, change `fleet-agent-identity`). Verified on the
  live record after the service picked up the code: every set-core entry in
  `~/.local/share/set-core/fleet-roster.json` now carries the framework's label
  (`set-core-34`, `set-core-bb`, …) and none carries a runtime-derived name.
  An agent the framework does not hold is recorded with `label: null` rather
  than with the derived name.
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by the user, after the first real reboot — *"a nevek nem álltak vissza"*.
- **measured:** the owner's log before the reboot names hand-chosen labels —
  `journalctl --user -u set-agent-owner` → `a viewer attached to set-core-bugfix`,
  `set-core-restart`, `consumer-app-tools`. After restore the same log names
  `started set-core-34 … resumed session 039178b5…`. The roster entry for that
  session carries `label: set-core-c6`, which is the runtime's own
  `nameSource: "derived"` name from `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, not the
  owner's terminal label: `roster._entry_from` (`lib/set_orch/fleet/roster.py:112`)
  reads `agent.name`, and `discovery` fills `name` from `record.get("name")`
  (`lib/set_orch/fleet/discovery.py:311`). The chosen label exists only in
  `OwnerClient().list_agents()[].label`, which the roster never asks.
- **fixed when:** with an agent started under a hand-typed label, the roster entry
  for its session carries THAT label, and after a restore the tab strip shows it.
  Direction that must not be taken: a label the owner does not hold must not be
  invented — an entry whose label is unknown states so rather than filling in a
  derived name.

### B-46 — the displayed name and the terminal label diverge after a resume, and the screen shows one while the framework holds the other
- **state:** closed (`ec614fcb`, change `fleet-agent-identity`). Measured on the
  live endpoint afterwards: every held agent's `name` equals its
  `terminal_label`, the runtime's string moved to `runtime_name`, and the one
  live collision (pid 54272 named `set-core-33` while pid 43704 holds that
  label) no longer reaches the screen — 54272 is now shown as `set-core-2225`,
  its own label. A foreign agent whose runtime name collides with a held label
  is shown with its pid rather than under the other agent's name.
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by the user, same report as B-45.
- **measured:** `GET /api/fleet/agents` right after the restore —
  `pid=43271 name=set-core-c6 terminal_label=set-core-34`, and seven more like it.
  A resumed session keeps its session id and gets a NEW derived name from the
  runtime, so the roster (which stores `name`) and the owner (which holds `label`)
  answer differently about the same agent from the moment of the resume. Already
  visible as a collision: pid 54272 is *named* `set-core-33` while pid 43704's
  *terminal label* is `set-core-33`.
- **fixed when:** one identity is displayed and it is the one every control keys
  on. `GET /api/fleet/agents` shows no agent whose displayed name is another
  agent's `terminal_label`.

### B-47 — a docked panel survives a reboot by LABEL, and restore recreates no label, so the pane comes back empty
- **state:** open — the mechanism is shipped (`b29e5240`: a rename carries the
  dock AND its stored width; `753021a7`: restore brings an agent back under its
  recorded label), and the unit tests cover both. It stays OPEN because the
  LIVE half is unproven: the owner service still runs pre-rename code, so no
  rename has yet completed on the running fleet, and the existing dock still
  names `set-core-bugfix` — a label lost before any of this existed. It closes
  when a docked agent has been renamed on screen and the panel followed.
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by the user — *"a jobb oldali agent sem állt be jobb
  oldalra layout szerint (gondolom a neve miatt)"*. Their guess is correct.
- **measured:** `~/.local/share/set-core/fleet-layout.json` →
  `docks: {"set-core": [{"kind":"agent","id":"set-core-bugfix","edge":"right"}]}`,
  while no live agent carries that label (`GET /api/fleet/agents` lists
  `set-core-34/-bb/-e2/-42/-4f/-5c/-33/-2225`). LOOKED at, 2026-08-21: the right
  pane reads *"no running agent with this terminal in set-core — the panel is
  kept, not closed"*. The dock is keyed on `terminal_label`
  (`web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx:1880`), which B-45 does not restore.
- **fixed when:** after a restore of an agent that was docked before, its panel is
  on the same edge. The empty-pane message stays correct for a genuinely absent
  agent — it is the honest half of this, and must not be removed to hide B-45.

### B-35 — the "waiting for a human" count reads its OWN documentation as an open question, on a task that is already done
- **state:** closed (`70fd5577`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by the user, from the screen — *"3 waiting for a human
  felül de ha rákattintok nem ugrik rá az elsőre, vagy ráugrik de az már nem abban
  a státuszban kellene legyen"*.
- **measured:** `GET /api/fleet/agents` →
  `set-core.awaiting = {"decision": ["fleet-view#9.15"], ..., "total": 1}`.
  The source line is `openspec/changes/fleet-view/tasks.md:148`, and it is
  `- [x] 9.15 …` — a task marked DONE, whose text *describes the mechanism*:
  «`connector.mark_awaiting` writes `<!-- awaiting: … -->` into the change's own
  task file». `open_decisions` (`lib/set_orch/fleet/awaiting.py:230`) matches
  `_AWAITING_MARKER` anywhere on the line, so the quoted example is read as a
  live marker.
- **two defects, and the second is the general one:**
  1. **A completed task cannot be awaiting a human.** The checkbox state is not
     read at all — `[x]`, `[ ]` and `[~]` are treated identically.
  2. **A marker quoted inside inline code is read as a marker.** The
     prose-read-as-fact class: the file documenting the mechanism is inside the
     corpus the mechanism scans.
- **the direction:** it INVENTS work. The header sends the reader to a project
  that is not waiting for anything, which is the fastest way to make a
  legitimate signal ignored — and the count is the first number on the screen.
- **fixed when / verified:** `open_decisions` over this repo returns `[]` while a
  fixture with a genuinely open `- [ ] 1.1 … <!-- awaiting: q -->` still returns
  it. Measured after: `GET /api/fleet/agents` → `awaiting: 2`, both consumer-app's
  (`orphaned: ["returns-and-commissions", "driver-photos-storage"]`), and the
  header on screen reads `2 waiting for a human`.
- **the guard:** a test asserts against THIS repository's own
  `openspec/changes`, because the fixture is written by whoever already
  understands the bug — and it was proven able to fire (both strippers removed →
  it fails).

### B-1 — an agent can only be stopped through an open terminal, and closing that terminal is a detach
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user (*"hogyan tudlak bezárni? nincs is ilyen
  gomb?"*), relayed by a peer session
- **measured:** the route exists (`lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:586`) and the web UI
  calls it from exactly one place — `web/src/components/FleetTerminal.tsx:200`,
  the terminal header. So stopping is reachable only for an agent that has a
  terminal AND has it open. There is no stop on the tile.
  ⚠ The peer reported this as "the screen cannot stop an agent at all"; that is
  wider than what the code says, and the narrower statement is the one to work
  from.
- **the part that is worse than a missing button:** closing the terminal panel is
  a *detach*, stated in that component's own comment against requirement 5.4 —
  the owner keeps the pty. A reader who closes it can reasonably believe they
  stopped the agent. That is a false absence in a control: the screen suggests it
  is over while the process runs.
- **fixed when:** a stop is reachable from the tile without opening a terminal,
  one agent at a time, and the confirmation names what it stops — the label and
  the pid are different things and the reader sees the label.

### B-2 — nothing typechecks `web/tests/e2e/**`
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by this session, while checking a new spec
- **measured:** the root `web/tsconfig.json` is `{"files": [], "references": [...]}`,
  so `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` checks **zero files** and exits 0 on anything.
  `npx tsc -b` builds the referenced projects, and their includes are
  `tsconfig.app.json` → `["src"]` and `tsconfig.node.json` → `["vite.config.ts"]`.
  `npx tsc -b --listFiles | grep -c tests/e2e` → **0**.
- **why it survived:** Playwright transpiles without typechecking, so a type error
  in a spec shows up as a runtime failure or not at all. And `tsc --noEmit -p .`
  *looks* like a check — it is the command a reader reaches for, and it is the one
  that measures nothing.
- **fixed when:** a tsconfig covers `tests/`, and a deliberate type error in a spec
  makes the check fail.

### B-3 — the first row of the modules panel refuses: `core-rules` is a capability with no installable module
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by a peer session and independently measured here
- **measured:** the capability report for a project lists `core-rules`, `starter`,
  `capacitor-nextjs`, `nextjs`; `POST /api/fleet/projects/<name>/install` with
  `{"module":"core-rules","dry_run":true}` → **409** `no module named 'core-rules'
  ships with this framework (looked under .../modules)`. The other three → 200.
  So the capability namespace and the installable-module namespace overlap in 3 of 4.
- **why it matters more than a 409:** it is the first row in the panel, so it is
  the first thing a reader clicks. The surface renders it correctly as a refusal —
  the defect is upstream, in the two namespaces disagreeing.
- **fixed when:** every capability the report names either resolves to a module or
  is not offered as installable, and the panel's first row is not a dead end.
- **traced 2026-08-19, and it needs a DECISION rather than a patch.** The two
  namespaces are built from two different sources and neither is wrong:
  `framework_capabilities()` (`lib/set_orch/fleet/capabilities.py:186`) derives
  `core-rules` from the directory that ships the rules, `templates/core/rules/*.md`;
  `resolve_module()` (`lib/set_orch/module_install.py:447`) resolves a name by
  globbing `modules/*/*/templates/<name>/manifest.yaml`, and the core rules have
  no manifest and do not live under `modules/`. So the report is right that the
  capability exists and the installer is right that no module carries it.
- **two ways out, and the difference is who owns the files:**
  - **(a) make it installable** — widen the resolver to build a declaration from
    the same directory the report reads. Truthful, because those rules ARE
    deployed; `set-project init` does it. ⚠ But `templates/core/rules/*.md`
    deploy **un-prefixed into the project's own namespace** and are `once: true`
    seeded (see `ae9706bb`), so this panel would gain a button that writes files
    a consumer owns. That is a write path into a foreign tree, and this repo's
    whole 2026-07-19 safety track is about not adding one by accident.
  - **(b) make the report honest** — the capability declares that this panel
    cannot install it and names what does (`set-project init`). Not a false
    absence: the claim is *this surface cannot install it*, not *these rules do
    not exist*. Cheap, and it ends the dead end.
- **recommendation: (b), and (a) only on the user's say-so.** (b) removes the
  reported defect — the first row stops refusing — without this screen growing a
  new way to write into somebody else's repository. Left undone deliberately
  rather than half-built.

### B-4 — `check_requirements` cannot fire: no shipped module declares `requires:`
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by this session, while writing the 9.17 e2e
- **measured:** `grep -ln requires modules/*/*/templates/*/manifest.yaml` → no
  matches, across all three shipped manifests (`starter`, `capacitor-nextjs`,
  `nextjs`). The check itself is wired (`lib/set_orch/module_install.py:380`) and
  raises `InstallRefused`.
- **consequence:** the "refused for a missing requirement" path is code nothing can
  trigger, and its e2e assertion has to fulfil the answer rather than provoke it.
- **fixed when:** at least one shipped module declares a real requirement, so the
  refusal can be reached by clicking — `capacitor-nextjs` requiring `nextjs` is the
  obvious candidate and should be checked against what that module actually needs.

### B-5 — an agent becomes un-instructable because a *different* tile was enlarged
- **state:** closed (`0b211f2f`) — it was the remainder of task 7.3
- **fixed:** the row is a `div` with the same guarded click the card uses, and it
  carries `FleetInstruct` in a `compact` frame. Two regression tests, both
  mutation-proven: dropping the input fails one, dropping the guard fails the
  other — and the guard is the load-bearing half, because without it every click
  inside the input would also enlarge the row.
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by a peer session at handover, verified here
- **measured:** with one tile enlarged the others render through `AgentRow`, and
  `AgentRow` carries neither the input nor the excerpt —
  `grep -c 'FleetInstruct|Excerpt'` over its body → **0**.
- **fixed when:** a row keeps its input, so enlarging one tile does not remove the
  ability to instruct the rest.

### B-6 — 14 changes fail `openspec validate --strict`
- **state:** open, long-standing, not this thread's
- **reported:** carried forward from the handoff profile (12 on 2026-08-17)
- **measured:** 2026-08-19 15:40 —
  `for c in $(ls openspec/changes/ | grep -v archive); do openspec validate "$c" --strict >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "$c"; done | wc -l` → **14**
- **fixed when:** the count is 0, or each remaining one is named here with a reason.

### B-9 — the shipped statusline's `Agents: N` is always 0: it reads a key the runtime does not send
- **state:** closed (`e2eb3dab`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by this session, while measuring the context-window carrier
- **measured:** a project-local `statusLine` command dumping its stdin was run twice
  under a pty — once with no subagent, once in a run that spawned one
  (`Agent(Calculate 2+2)`, observed finishing on screen). The payload's top-level
  keys in BOTH captures:
  `session_id, transcript_path, cwd, prompt_id, session_name, model, workspace,
  version, output_style, cost, context_window, exceeds_200k_tokens, fast_mode,
  thinking, rate_limits` — **`agents` is not among them.** The shipped scripts read
  `jq -r '.agents // [] | length'` (`mcp-server/statusline.sh:25`, `install.sh:831`),
  so the `// []` fallback turns a missing key into an empty list and the count is
  structurally 0.
- **the class, not the typo:** a zero produced by a *missing key* rather than by an
  empty set — the shape error this repository already names. It reports "no agents"
  for a session that has them, and it does so in the one line a reader glances at.
- ⚠ **limit of the measurement, stated so it is not over-trusted:** the dump file
  holds the LAST render, which in the subagent run may have been taken after the
  child finished. So `agents` is measured absent in 2 of 2 captures, but NOT proven
  absent *while* a subagent is mid-flight. Re-check by capturing every render, not
  the last one, before concluding the key never exists.
- **fixed when:** the field the statusline counts is one the runtime actually sends
  (or the count is removed), and a session with a live subagent shows a non-zero
  figure — proven by a capture taken while the child is running, not after it.

### B-10 — `context-window-metrics` divides by a hardcoded 200 000, which is wrong for this repo's own sessions
- **state:** closed (`e52ccdc4`) — **owned by the change `agent-goal-and-lifecycle`**, listed here
  because it was found while measuring something else and predates that change
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by this session
- **measured:** `openspec/specs/context-window-metrics/spec.md:47` requires
  `CONTEXT_WINDOW_SIZE = 200_000` as the divisor of every utilization percentage.
  The runtime reports `context_window.context_window_size` **per model** in the
  statusline payload. Re-measured 2026-08-19 on an agent started with the
  framework's own default argv (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`,
  `ownerd.py:65`, model `claude-opus-5`): its status line read
  **`Ctx: 4% (36801/1000k)`** — a 1M window. The constant renders that same
  session as **18 %**.
- **fail direction:** it over-reports utilization by the ratio of the real window to
  200 000 — measured at **5×** on the framework's own default agent, so a session
  with 96 % of its context free is displayed as nearly full. That is the direction
  that triggers unnecessary action.
- **fixed when:** the divisor comes from the reported size, an unreported size
  renders as unknown rather than as a percentage, and a session on a non-200k model
  shows a figure that matches what the runtime says.

### B-8 — the log view does not open at the latest, and its tool lines say nothing
- **state:** closed (`e52ccdc4`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"scrollbar mindig alul kell legyen hogy
  latest mutassa, illetve a Bash és tool feliratok nem mutatnak semmit a lognál
  csak a helyet viszok, át kell gondolni"*
- **measured:** the conversation list renders `16:24 Bash ↵1` rows between the
  spoken turns; the row carries a tool NAME and a count and nothing about what
  the tool did, so a reader learns only that something happened. And the scroll
  box starts at the top, so the newest turn — the one the reader came for — is
  off screen on any log with history.
- **fixed when:** the box is scrolled to the newest turn on open and stays there
  while new turns arrive unless the reader has scrolled away; and a tool line
  either carries something a reader can act on or does not take a row.

### B-14 — the project rows are thin, and a richer design that once existed is gone
- **state:** closed (`28ef5ce7`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"még mindig kicsik a projekt csempék.
  korábban vagy 3 soros status állapotokkal meg minden volt tervezve és egyszer
  láttam is, az hova lett? ki kell bővíteni minden funkcióval amit érdemes látni
  ikonokkal"*
- **searched first, and the answer was NO:** the earlier three-line design is in
  neither `design.md` nor the file's git history (six commits, all recent). What
  IS written down is the spec's own word — it says *project TILE* while the
  implementation was a thin row. That gap is what got rebuilt, rather than a
  design invented on top of a half-remembered one.
- **fixed when:** the project row carries what is worth seeing, in icons, and the
  earlier design is either restored or explicitly superseded with a reason.
- **closed:** `28ef5ce7` — three lines: name · states + agent count + conflict ·
  capability marks + oldest stillness + sources. The earlier design is explicitly
  SUPERSEDED, not restored: the search above found it nowhere, so the spec's own
  word (*project tile*) is what got built.

### B-15 — an agent tile can be almost entirely empty while the log has plenty to say
- **state:** closed (`f64c7554`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"nem hiszem hogy üres kellene legyen
  akár egy agent is., már biztosan van róla valami log, info"*
- **measured:** a tile whose excerpt is one short sentence leaves the rest of its
  ~500 px empty, while the same agent's log endpoint has turns and tool activity
  to show.
- **fixed when:** a tile with room to spare fills it from what is actually known
  about the agent, rather than leaving the space blank.
- **closed:** `f64c7554` — a tile shows its LOG by default
  (`web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx:458-460`), and clicking it hands over the live
  terminal. Measured live at 2026-08-19 17:0x: 3 tiles showing a log, 2 of them
  clickable — exactly the 2 the framework started.

### B-11 — the excerpt spills over several lines where one and an ellipsis would do
- **state:** closed (`e52ccdc4`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"ez a több soros first message az agent
  után értelmetlen. le kell vágni egy sorba aztán ..."*
- **measured:** the tile clamps the excerpt at 12 lines since `c4f4842f`, which
  was an overcorrection: it filled the taller tile with ONE long message instead
  of with information.
- ⚠ **reported together with B-10 and they pull in opposite directions on the
  same space** — one line for the message, and the freed space filled with
  something structured rather than more prose. Fixing either alone gets it wrong.
- **fixed when:** the excerpt is a single line ending in an ellipsis, and what
  fills the tile is not the excerpt.

### B-12 — inside a grid tile the terminal and the log stop at a fixed height and leave the column empty
- **state:** closed (`e52ccdc4`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user, twice — *"oszlop engedné de nem megy le
  alulra a terminál … kihasználni az adott hasábot, területet amit a layout tesz"*
  and *"sima log nézetben jobb oldalt látjuk hogy félbevágja, nem húzza le a log
  nézetet a terület aljáig"*
- **measured:** the tiles themselves DO fill their row since `c4f4842f`; what
  does not fill is what is inside them. `FleetTerminal`'s host is `h-72` and
  `LogPanel`'s scroll box is `max-h-80` unless the tile is enlarged or full
  screen — so in a grid tile both are cut at a fixed height with the rest of the
  column blank below.
- **why the first fix missed it:** `c4f4842f` replaced the guessed `62vh`/`55vh`
  with flex **only on the full-screen path**, because that was the path in the
  report. The same guess in the ordinary path was left standing, and it is the
  one a reader meets every time.
- **fixed when:** in any tile that has height to give, the terminal and the log
  take what is left, with a floor so a short tile stays usable.

### B-13 — a terminal in a narrow column re-wraps into an unreadable strip
- **state:** closed (`e52ccdc4`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"kevés a hely de hülyén tördel a
  terminál … nagyban jól működik"*
- **measured:** `FitAddon.fit()` sets the column count from the container's
  width, and the resize is sent on to the pty. In a narrow tile that means the
  AGENT re-renders its own terminal UI at ~30 columns, which no terminal program
  is designed for — the screenshot shows a body wrapped to a third of the width
  with a one-character column stranded at the right edge.
- **the shape, and why "wrap better" is the wrong fix:** a terminal is a
  fixed-grid device. Its content was laid out by the program for a given number
  of columns, so re-flowing it is not a rendering choice — it destroys the
  layout the program produced. The repair is a FLOOR on the columns plus a
  window onto the result, never a cleverer wrap.
- **fixed when:** a narrow tile shows a scrollable window onto a terminal that is
  still at least 80 columns wide, and the pty is never told it is narrower.

### B-16 — a terminal re-attached after a project switch draws a broken screen until a keystroke repairs it

- **state:** open — the cause is found and the fix is shipped in code, and the
  entry stays open because nobody has yet performed the reported recipe against
  the running build. A fix is a fix when somebody LOOKS; until then this is a
  repair of the mechanism the screenshot is consistent with.
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"terminal also status bar elromlik ha
  projektet valtok, beleirok, majd visszavaltok"*, and then the half that names
  the cause: *"beiras utan megjavul"*
- **measured:** reported with a screenshot, NOT yet reproduced by a session —
  said plainly so nobody quotes this as a measurement. The recipe is exact:
  switch to another project, type into an agent there, switch back. The agent's
  status bar comes back mangled — in the screenshot only `34236` and
  `· ← 7 agents` survive of a line that is normally full width — and any
  keystroke restores it.
- **what the repair-on-keystroke rules OUT, which is the useful half:** the
  socket is fine, the pty is fine and the buffer is fine. A keystroke changes
  nothing about any of them; what it does is make the REMOTE program repaint.
  So the screen is stale, not lost — a redraw that never happened rather than
  bytes that never arrived.
- **where to look first:** switching projects unmounts the tile, so coming back
  is a fresh attach: `FleetTerminal` replays the buffered screen and a
  `ResizeObserver` refits xterm. A replay written at one column count and
  refitted to another leaves exactly this — a line that was drawn for a
  different width, with nothing prompting the far end to redraw it. The column
  FLOOR (80) shipped in `387ba8c2`, so the tile's width and the pty's width are
  deliberately allowed to differ, which is what makes the ordering matter.
- **fixed when:** switch away, type, switch back — the status bar is whole
  before anything is typed. Prove it the way this repo proves a fix: break the
  ordering again and watch the check go red.
- **what was found, and it is structural rather than a guess:** the `attached`
  ack reaches the browser BEFORE any replay byte — `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py`
  sends it, then starts the output pump — and it carried how MUCH was replayed
  and never what SHAPE it was. So the viewer fitted to its own tile and then
  rendered a screen that a program had laid out for some other width. A terminal
  is a fixed-grid device: that does not adapt the screen, it destroys it, and
  silently, because the result still looks like a terminal.
- **the repair, in two ordered steps:** the ack now carries the pty's geometry,
  READ from the master fd with `TIOCGWINSZ` rather than remembered (a stored
  copy drifts the moment anything else resizes the window); the viewer adopts
  that shape before the first replayed byte, and sends its own size back only
  once the replay has landed — counted down from `replayed_bytes`, with a
  one-second fallback so a short replay cannot leave the pty stuck.
- **proven by mutation, not by a green run:** 4 of 6 client tests fail on the
  old ordering, the 5th on substituting a default geometry for `null`, and 2 of
  4 owner tests fail when the size is remembered instead of read. Restores
  verified by file identity.

### B-17 — set-core's PUBLISHED history still names private consumer projects, and a fork network makes that permanent
- **state:** open — deliberately, and the decision is the entry
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"ellenőrizd, hogy ... ne tudjon kimenni
  personális adat token projektspecifikus olyan, ami problémát jelent"*
- **measured:** `git grep -lE '<slugs>' origin/main` → **34 files**;
  `git log origin/main --format='%s%n%b' | grep -icE '<slugs>'` → **8 commit
  messages**; the published tag `refs/tags/orch/complete` carries **10**. The slug
  list is built at run time from `~/.config/set-core/projects.json`, never stored
  in the repo.
- **why it is not being fixed the obvious way:** `gh repo view` reports **6 forks
  and 30 stars**. GitHub keeps a fork network's objects reachable by SHA, so a
  `filter-repo` + force-push would rewrite every SHA, break every clone, and still
  not remove the content. The five sibling public repos have **0 forks**, and all
  five were fully scrubbed instead (`set-agent-comm`, `set-copilot`, `set-atlas`,
  `set-demo`, `set-claude-handoff`).
- **what was done instead:** the working tree is clean (`set-leakscan --tree` →
  0 findings), and both gates are installed so nothing new joins it.
- **how you would know it changed:** `set-leakscan --tree` in this repo reports
  only `consumer-name:commit-message` entries, all of them reachable from
  `origin/main` — never a content finding, and never one in `origin/main..HEAD`.

### B-18 — two local backup tags hold the pre-scrub content, and `push --tags` would republish it
- **state:** open
- **measured:** `git tag -l 'backup-*'` → `backup-pre-scrub-2026-07-24`,
  `backup-preslugscrub-20260731`; each resolves to a commit whose history carries
  8 leaking commit messages. `git ls-remote --tags origin | grep backup` → **empty**,
  so they are local only *today*.
- **why it matters:** this is rule 8 of `.claude/rules/release-safety.md` observed
  in the wild — a scrub's own leftovers. A single `git push --tags`, `--mirror` or
  `--all` publishes exactly what an earlier scrub removed.
- **how you would know it is fixed:** either the tags are deleted, or a push
  refspec policy exists that cannot name them. Verified by
  `git ls-remote --tags origin | grep -c backup` staying 0 after any push.

### B-19 — the public GitLab mirror of set-core was not updated with the cleanup
- **state:** CLOSED 2026-08-20. `git push gitlab main` → `83245a86..d193b775`;
  `git ls-remote <gitlab> main` and `git rev-parse HEAD` now return the same
  `d193b775`. Verified by comparing the two, not by the push reporting success.
- **measured:** `curl .../api/v4/projects?per_page=100` anonymously lists exactly
  two public projects on the self-hosted instance: `root/set-core` and
  `root/craftbrew-run`. The mirror's newest commit is **2026-07-09**, i.e. it
  predates the cleanup entirely. (`root/craftbrew-run` holds only GitLab's default
  README — nothing to clean.)
- **how you would know it is fixed:** the mirror's tip equals the GitHub tip, and
  `set-leakscan --tree` run against a fresh clone of it is clean.

### B-20 — set-voice-agent-delivery's two remotes have diverged: GitLab refused the scrubbed history
- **state:** open
- **measured:** `git push --force gitlab main` →
  `GitLab: You are not allowed to force push code to a protected branch on this
  project` / `[remote rejected] ... (pre-receive hook declined)`. GitHub took the
  same push. That GitLab project is **not** in the public list, so nothing is
  exposed — but the two copies now hold different histories, and the GitLab one
  still contains a real phone number.
- **how you would know it is fixed:** unprotect `main` on that project, force-push,
  re-protect; then `git rev-parse origin/main gitlab/main` returns one SHA twice.

### B-21 — a project the screen SHOWS, with a start control next to it, refuses the start

- **state:** closed (`ec391a78`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user, with a screenshot: the panel header names
  the project and its path, offers *start an agent*, and the answer is
  *"… is not a project this screen knows; register it first"*
- **measured, in-process against the running server:** the list serves **49**
  projects; `_known_roots()` — the guard the start endpoint asks — knew **39**.
  **10 projects were shown with a start control and refused**: 9 supplied only by
  the messaging registry, 1 by a live process whose root the guard's own
  enumeration missed.
- **cause, and it is not about any one project:** the guard ENUMERATED ITS OWN
  SOURCES — the registry, plus the roots of discovered agents — which is a second
  definition of *what this screen knows*. It was correct while the list had those
  same two sources and went wrong silently when a third arrived. The union's
  downstream filter had already been bitten by the same third source
  (`api/fleet.py`, the note at the `if not members and not project.sources`
  line); that one was fixed and this one was not.
- **the class:** *completing a set means auditing everything downstream of it* —
  any later step that re-states the set is a copy, and it drifted the moment the
  set changed. The guard now asks the list rather than rebuilding it, so a
  fourth source cannot reintroduce this.
- **a second finding fell out, and it nearly caused a mirrored bug:** the fix's
  first docstring claimed archived projects stay out, taken from
  `discover_projects`'s own docstring — *"an `archived` project is excluded by
  every other surface in this framework, so it is excluded here too"*. Measured:
  **19 of the 49 served projects are archived**, and the screen shows them all.
  Believing that sentence and filtering here would have rebuilt the same
  divergence in the other direction. See B-22.
- **proven by mutation, both directions:** restoring the two-source guard fails
  2 of 4 tests; making the guard accept everything fails 2 of 4 — a different 2,
  including the one that keeps the protection. Restore verified by file identity.
- **⚠ one thing this fix does NOT answer.** The refusal told the reader to
  *register it first*, and the screen offers no way to do that. `set-project
  init` does register (`bin/set-project`, the *Add project to registry* branch),
  but the reported project is not in `~/.config/set-core/projects.json` — so
  either that command did not run for it or it ran under another name. Not
  investigated further, and not guessed at here.

### B-22 — `discover_projects`'s docstring claims an archived filter the code does not have

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by this session, while fixing B-17
- **measured:** the docstring says *"an `archived` project is excluded by every
  other surface in this framework, so it is excluded here too — but the flag is
  carried rather than dropped"*. The code below it sets `archived=` on the entry
  and never filters on it; `grep -n archived lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py` finds one
  use, and it is the field being copied into the response. Live: **19 of 49
  served projects are archived**, all shown.
- **why it is worth an entry rather than a one-word edit:** this is the *comment
  claiming a guard the code does not have* class, and it already cost something —
  it was read as fact while writing B-17's fix and nearly produced a mirrored
  version of the very bug being repaired. A comment that is wrong is worse than
  none, because the next reader stops looking.
- **it needs a DECISION, not just a rewrite:** either the sentence is stale and
  should describe what the function does, or the filter was intended and is
  missing — in which case 19 projects are on screen that this framework's other
  surfaces exclude, which is a bigger question than a docstring.
- **fixed when:** the docstring and the code agree, and whichever way it is
  settled, a test holds it — the wrong reading is what has to be unable to come
  back.

### B-23 — a refused send says it failed four times and offers a remedy for a cause it never reached

- **state:** closed (`1d8f41a4`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user with a screenshot — *"send comand hibára
  futott"*
- **measured, off the reported card, in render order:** `refused` ·
  *the agent does not have it* · *the send was not made*, then *the send did not
  happen*, then the channel's own reason, then — in **amber** — a remedy about
  missing waiters. Four statements that it failed, one cause, and the amber went
  to the wrong one.
- **the defect is not the wording, it is a claim about a stage never reached.**
  `offerWaiterRemedy()` fired on `waiters_here === 0` alone. That count is a
  true measurement of a condition the send never got to: the channel refused it
  at the room check, so nothing left, and the sentence it produced —
  *"every instruction sent here sits unread"* — is present tense about messages
  that do not exist. Same class as a count taken from a declaration instead of
  from the data: the number is right and the thing it is offered as evidence FOR
  was not in play.
- **and the colours were inverted.** Amber means *needs attention* everywhere on
  this screen. The remedy that could not work had it; the remedy that would have
  worked — the channel's own *join the room first, then send* — was `fg-ghost`,
  the faintest thing on the card. A colour spent on the wrong thing is worse
  than no colour, because it is followed.
- **fixed:** the remedy requires that a send was actually made (`accepted !==
  false`; an ABSENT `accepted` is still offered, so an older server does not
  lose a real remedy); after a refusal *the agent does not have it* is dropped
  as a restatement of the first fact and the delivery state stays in the DOM
  marker; the channel's notices are no longer the quietest line.
- **proven by mutation:** restoring the unconditional remedy fails 2 tests,
  restoring the restatement fails 2 (one of them a pre-existing 409 test),
  returning the notices to `fg-ghost` fails 1. Restores verified by file
  identity. 570 web unit tests green, build exit 0.
- **⚠ what is NOT fixed, deliberately:** the label/note pair still reads
  *refused* / *the send did not happen*, which is one restatement remaining. It
  is left because the note table is static and the fix that reads well —
  suppressing a generic note when the channel gave a specific one — would also
  drop `held`'s note, which carries something no reason does (the hold expires
  on its own). Worth a decision, not a quiet edit.

### B-24 — `CLAUDE.md` sends every session to `START.md`, and that file does not exist
- **state:** open
- **measured:** `CLAUDE.md:807` reads *"See [START.md](START.md) for application
  startup commands (install, dev server, database, tests)."*; `ls START.md` →
  no such file, and `git log --diff-filter=D -- START.md` finds no deletion
  either, so it was never committed.
- **why it matters more than a broken link:** it is in the *rule book*, which is
  loaded into every session's context. An agent asked how to start the app is
  pointed at nothing, and the failure is silent — a missing file reads as
  "nothing to see" rather than as an error.
- **⚠ WIDER THAN ONE REPOSITORY, measured 2026-08-20.** `set-project init`
  *writes this sentence into every consumer's `CLAUDE.md`* ("Added Getting
  Started reference to CLAUDE.md"), and deploys no `START.md` beside it —
  `find templates modules -name START.md` → 0. Across the registry: **35
  projects carry the reference and 20 of them have no such file.** So this is
  not set-core's own oversight; it is a defect the deploy path propagates, and
  it grows by one with every init. Found while running a first init into a
  project that had never had one.
- **how you would know it is fixed:** either `START.md` exists and lists the
  install / dev-server / database / test commands, or the sentence names a file
  that does.

### B-25 — three repositories tracked a file their own `.gitignore` claimed to exclude
- **state:** closed for the three found (one public `set-*` project and two
  private ones); open as a *class* until the deploy path carries the check
- **measured:** `git check-ignore --no-index -q <path>` over `git ls-files`.
  **The `--no-index` is the whole finding**: without it git refuses to call a
  TRACKED path ignored, so the obvious form of this check returns zero for
  exactly the condition it exists to detect. An earlier report in this session
  stated "0 in all 16 repositories" on the strength of that broken check.
- **what it had been shipping:** a real phone number (`contacts.yaml`, added to
  `.gitignore` by a commit literally titled *remove personal data from repo* —
  with no `git rm --cached` beside it, so the intent was recorded and the effect
  never happened); a config file; and a **dictation transcript with 16 spoken
  entries**.
- **how you would know the class is closed:** `set-project init` deploys a
  `pre-push` hook running `set-leakscan`, whose `ignored-but-tracked` category is
  enforced regardless of remote visibility.

### B-26 — the dashboard's optional Discord bot fails on startup, and the traceback is the last line before a 40-second silence
- **state:** open. Not blocking: the failure is caught, and the service does come
  up — but only after a wait long enough that the first two checks after a
  restart both answered "not listening".
- **measured:** `systemctl --user restart set-web`, then
  `journalctl --user -u set-web`:
  `[SET] Discord bot startup failed: module 'discord' has no attribute 'Intents'`
  at `lib/set_orch/discord/__init__.py:65`, from `server.py:54`. A `discord`
  module IS importable — it simply is not the library this code expects, so the
  import succeeds and the attribute access is where it fails.
- **the part worth fixing, which is not the bot:** the traceback is printed at
  the exact moment the service looks dead from outside, so it reads as the cause
  of an outage it has nothing to do with. Two `curl` calls returned `000` after
  the restart while the process was still loading 40 projects; a third, a minute
  later, returned `200`. A reader following the obvious evidence would have gone
  to debug Discord.
- **how you would know it is fixed:** the startup path either does not attempt a
  bot whose library is absent, or reports the attempt as skipped rather than as a
  traceback; and the service says when it is *ready to serve*, distinctly from
  when it started. A restart followed by an immediate `curl` should then not be
  ambiguous.

### B-27 — one docking test fails about one full-suite run in ten, and passes alone

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by this session, while running the web suite for an
  unrelated verification pass
- **measured:** `npx vitest run` over the whole web suite, ten times.
  **Two runs failed, both on the same test** —
  `fleetDockingSurface.test.tsx::undocks by pressing the edge it is already on,
  so the control is never a dead end` — and eight passed 675/675. The same file
  alone: 12/12. The file together with the suite that was suspected of polluting
  it (`fleetTilePrecedence`): 21/21, in both orders. At `HEAD` with this
  session's working-tree changes stashed: 12/12.
- **what that rules out, and why it is worth writing down:** the first failure
  arrived immediately after this session added tests, so the obvious reading was
  *my change broke it*. It did not — the two runs that isolate the pair are the
  evidence, and without them the next step would have been to "fix" a test that
  was never wrong. A flake and a break look identical from one run.
- **whose it is:** the `fleet-panel-layout` thread's, not this one's. Recorded
  rather than repaired here — the file was committed by another session and is
  under active work.
- **fixed when:** the CAUSE is asserted, not the symptom. A count of green runs
  is what this register already warns against: *a symptom that stops appearing
  is not a repair*, and a reproducer is a measurement with a timestamp. The
  useful shape is the one that worked for task 10.3 — find what makes it
  order- or timing-dependent and make THAT fatal, so the check does not depend
  on how the suite happens to be scheduled.

### B-28 — the no-seat sentence is repeated on every tile instead of said once

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by this session, from a screenshot of the running
  fleet screen
- **measured:** three agent tiles on one panel, each carrying the identical grey
  line *"no input: this session has no seat on the messaging bus"* — one row per
  tile, for one fact about the machine. Most agents on this host have no seat,
  so the count scales with the fleet.
- **why it is a defect and not a preference:** this repository already made the
  same call in the same screen and wrote a test for it —
  `tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py::test_the_reason_a_terminal_is_unavailable_is_said_once_not_per_row`.
  The terminal's unavailability is stated once at the top; the seat's absence is
  stated per row. Two identical situations, two different answers, and the
  inconsistent one is the one nobody tested.
- **⚠ what a fix must NOT do:** the sentence exists because task 4.4 requires the
  producer's reason to stand WHERE THE INPUT WOULD BE — deleting it from the
  tile and saying nothing would be the false-absence direction, which is what
  the amber-to-grey change of the same line already had to correct. The shape
  that works is the terminal's: once at the top, with the tile marking that it
  is covered by that statement rather than restating it.
- **fixed when:** a panel of N seatless agents carries the sentence once, every
  tile still says it cannot be typed into, and a test asserts BOTH — the count
  is one, and no tile is silent about its own state.

### B-30 — one unanswered owner poll unmounts the open terminal, which detaches it and costs a 64 KB replay

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by the user — *"időnként megáll a fleet view,
  connectionget ir és 1 perc mulva all vissza"* — together with the question the
  entry has to answer first: does anything get reset or suspended while it says
  that. It does not; see the last bullet.
- **measured:** the chain is four hops and every one of them is a `file:line`:
  - `connecting…` is only ever the MOUNT state — `web/src/components/FleetTerminal.tsx:100`
    sets it as the initial phase and nothing sets it again; a socket that drops
    while attached renders `closed` instead (`FleetTerminal.tsx:275`). So the word
    the user reads is proof of a REMOUNT, not of a reconnect.
  - the terminal is rendered conditionally: `web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx:1481` —
    `terminalOpen && offer.kind === 'available'`; the docked list filters the same
    way (`Fleet.tsx:1865`).
  - `available` requires `population === 'started-here'`
    (`web/src/lib/fleetTerminal.ts:87`), and the API downgrades EVERY agent to
    `unknown` when the owner could not be asked — `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:63-77`
    (`_owned_by_pid()` returns `None` on any `OwnerClientError`) and `:108-110`.
  - that call's read timeout is 30 s (`lib/set_orch/fleet/owner_client.py:36`), so
    one slow or refused answer covers several 5 s poll cycles — which is the
    minute the report names.
  - the journal shows the consequence in pairs, e.g. `12:16:15 detached from
    consumer-a-finance` / `12:16:26 attached to set-core-fleet (65536 replayed
    bytes, truncated=True)` — every re-attach re-sends the 64 KB tail.
- **what is NOT happening, because the question was asked:** nothing is reset and
  nothing is suspended. The unmount closes the browser socket only; the server
  logs `a browser detached` and the owner keeps the pty (task 5.4,
  `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:1098-1101`), so the agent runs through it. The screen
  loses the view, never the session.
- **caught in the act, 2026-08-20 12:30–12:37**, and the cause is NOT the owner —
  the probe (2 s sampling of `owner_reachable` and the population split) recorded
  `owner=True` on every answered poll. What it recorded instead:
  - `12:30:38 → 12:36:16` — the endpoint stops answering entirely: four samples at
    the probe's own 60 s ceiling (`lat=60.10 TimeoutError`). The process was alive;
    it just did not answer. The machine was under memory pressure at the time
    (`free -h`: 23 Gi of swap in use, load 5.6), with a 1.5 GB `next-server` and a
    vitest run on it — an environment fact, not a framework one, but the surface
    turns it into a blank terminal.
  - `12:36:17 → 12:37:48` — `systemd`: `Stopping SET Web Dashboard…` then
    `Started`, **91 s apart**, with `connection refused` throughout. That is
    `TimeoutStopUSec=1min 30s` exactly, and it is its own defect: see B-31.
  - `12:37:48` onwards — all five terminals re-attach, 65536 replayed bytes each.
  So the minute in the report has two producers, and the tile-unmount chain above
  is what turns either of them into `connecting…` rather than into a message.
- **fixed** in `8b8f60f5` (client), and the fix is the distinction the API already
  draws surviving the trip: `resolveTerminals` now takes `null` for *nobody could
  be asked* and filters nothing on it, while `[]` still means *asked, holds
  nothing*. Two narrow helpers carry the rest — `rememberTerminalLabels` (pid →
  last CONFIRMED label, rebuilt on every answer so it cannot go stale) and
  `offerWithRemembered` (upgrades `unknown` only, and only while the pane is
  already open, so no unperformable offer is ever made).
  - **verified by LOOKING, not only by counting:** the running screen with the
    fleet answer rewritten to `owner_reachable: false` / every agent `unknown` /
    no label — the terminal **stayed and stayed `attached`**, and the amber
    header appeared. Before/after: `b30-{1-normal,2-owner-silent}.png`.
  - 730/730 web unit tests, 6 new, three mutations each caught (null-as-filter →
    2 failures; `offerWithRemembered` neutered → 2; memory rebuilt without an
    answer → 1).
- **⚠ what is NOT fixed by this, and stays open:** the first producer in the
  measurement above — the six minutes in which the endpoint answered nothing at
  all under memory pressure. The screen now says what it does not know instead of
  taking the terminal away, which is the honest failure, not the absence of one.
- **⚠ the wiring landed in a file another thread is rewriting.** `Fleet.tsx` held
  457 deletions of parallel work when this was committed, so the helpers and the
  tests are in `8b8f60f5` and the call sites are not. They are in the working
  tree and will land with that thread's commit — see B-32.
  **How a later session checks that they did**, in one command, because "it is in
  the working tree" stops being true at the next rebase:

  ```bash
  cd web && npx vitest run tests/unit/fleetTerminalSurvivesUnknown.test.tsx
  ```

  Green means the call sites arrived. Red — specifically *keeps the pane when
  every agent comes back `unknown`* failing while the three pure-function tests
  pass — means the helpers survived and the wiring did not: look for
  `labelMemory`, the `projects` normalisation, `attachable`'s `null` branch and
  the `offerWithRemembered` call, with `git log -p -- web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx`.
  That split is diagnostic: the pure tests import the library directly, the
  wiring test renders the screen, so which half fails names which half is
  missing.

### B-31 — stopping set-web takes 91 s, so any restart is a 91 s hole in the dashboard

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by this session, from the journal while measuring B-30
- **measured:** `systemctl --user show set-web -p TimeoutStopUSec` → `1min 30s`, and
  two of today's three stops used every second of it:
  - `10:09:01 Stopping…` → `10:10:32 Stopped` → `Started` — 91 s
  - `12:36:17 Stopping…` → `12:37:48 Started` — 91 s
  - `09:29:25 Stopping… / Stopped / Started` — same second
  91 s is not a slow shutdown, it is the timeout expiring and systemd sending
  `SIGKILL`. Throughout the hole the port answers `connection refused` (probe log),
  so every open terminal drops and every poll fails.
- **cause found, and both candidates refuted first.** The journal says it in one
  line: `INFO: Waiting for background tasks to complete.` uvicorn's
  `timeout_graceful_shutdown` defaults to `None` — *wait for every running task,
  with no limit*. Refuted along the way, by measurement rather than by argument:
  - **not the WebSockets.** All three open terminals closed in the same second as
    `Stopping…` (`connection closed` ×3, `detached` ×3), and an isolated instance
    with an open terminal WebSocket exited in **0.5 s**.
  - **not `watchfiles`.** Same isolated measurement, same 0.5 s.
  - what held it were unfinished HTTP request tasks — the same six minutes in
    which the endpoint answered nothing at all (B-30's first producer).
- **fixed** in `532026d5`: `timeout_graceful_shutdown=10`
  (`SET_WEB_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT` overrides), with three tests and two mutations.
  The instrument was proven before it was adopted: a minimal app with one stuck
  request was **still alive 60 s** after `SIGTERM` with the default, and exited in
  **10.5 s** with the timeout set.
- **the fix is RUNNING** since the 20:23 restart (the process started after the
  commit, so it loaded the patched `cli.py`), and that restart took **2 s** —
  which proves nothing about the fix, because there was no stuck task to wait
  for. The old code would have taken 2 s too. Recorded so the number is not
  mistaken for evidence later.
- **⚠ still open: the closing check has been ATTEMPTED and the instrument ate it.**
  To make a request genuinely hang, an isolated instance was given a *silent*
  owner socket (accepts, never answers) so `OwnerClient` would sit on its 30 s
  read timeout. Results: `GRACE=10` → 28.6 s, `GRACE=2` → 28.0 s, and — the line
  that settles it — **no stuck request at all → 25.5 s**. The shutdown time is
  therefore dominated by the silent socket the measurement itself installed, not
  by the graceful window. Same defect class as the watcher count measured while
  the kernel table was full: *a resource meter cannot be trusted while the
  measurement is holding the resource.*
- **what would close it:** a real `Stopping…`/`Started` pair on the live service
  taken while a request is actually hanging — i.e. the next restart that happens
  under load. Single-digit seconds closes it; anything near 90 s reopens the
  cause. Do not substitute the isolated rig: it has now been shown to answer a
  different question.
- **why it is worth its own entry:** it converts a routine `restart` — which
  agents and the user both do — into a minute of dead dashboard, and B-30's tile
  chain makes that minute read as `connecting…` rather than as "the server is
  restarting". A `SIGKILL`ed server also never runs its shutdown path.
- **fixed when:** `systemctl --user restart set-web` completes in single-digit
  seconds with terminals open, and the journal shows `Stopped` without the
  timeout — measured, not assumed, from the `Stopping…`/`Started` timestamps.

### B-32 — two agents that BOTH staged only their own paths still lose a commit to each other, because the index is shared

- **state:** closed (`cba66f78` + the wiring commit that follows it) — see the
  verification at the end of this entry
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by this session, after it happened to this session
  while archiving `fleet-panel-layout`.
- **measured, on the real incident:** this session staged exactly its own 8 paths
  (`git add openspec/changes/fleet-panel-layout openspec/changes/archive/… openspec/specs/fleet-dockable-views openspec/specs/fleet-panel-dividers`),
  `set-leakscan --staged` confirmed 8 files, and the following `git commit` printed
  `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. The 8 files are in **`066e6233`**, a
  third thread's *"plan(fleet-pm-mode)"* commit — 16 files, 1165 insertions — whose
  message says nothing about any of them. Verified with
  `git log --oneline -3 -- openspec/specs/fleet-dockable-views/spec.md`.
- **measured, on the mechanism, in a throwaway repo:** the existing rule does not
  defend against this. `.claude/rules/cross-cutting-checklist.md` prescribes
  `git add <path>` instead of `git add -A` — that covers only the sweep of
  *unstaged* work. Two agents each staged one file of their own, then agent A ran
  `git commit` with **no pathspec**: the commit carried both files. There is one
  index per checkout, so a pathspec-less commit publishes whatever anybody staged.
- **why this is the expensive direction:** the content survives, so nothing errors
  and no test notices. What is destroyed is the *attribution and the message* — the
  losing agent's commit message, with its evidence, never exists, and the other
  side's `git status` reads CLEAN, which is indistinguishable from "my work is gone".
- **the cure, measured in the same repo:** `git commit -- <paths>` committed only
  the named path, and the other agent's staged entry **survived in the index,
  untouched**, and was absent from the commit. One limitation measured: the form
  fails with `pathspec … did not match any file(s) known to git` for a path git does
  not yet track, so `git add <own paths>` is still required first — the pathspec
  belongs on the commit *in addition to*, not instead of, the add.
- **⚠ what a fix must NOT do:** it must not block every pathspec-less commit
  unconditionally — a gate that fires daily on nothing gets disabled, and solo work
  in a private checkout is not the hazard. And it must not try to repair an incident
  after the fact by amending or rebasing the other thread's commit: that takes back
  what another agent is holding right now, which this repository already ruled is
  more expensive than a badly grouped commit.
- **fixed when:** an agent cannot produce a commit carrying a path another session
  staged. Demonstrated by a test that stages a foreign path, runs the guard over a
  pathspec-less `git commit`, and sees it refuse with the `--` remedy named; plus
  the same guard refusing `git add -A`. And the refusal must NOT fire when every
  staged path was staged by the committing session.
- **verified 2026-08-21:** `bin/set-hook-checkout-guard`, registered on both
  `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` for the `Bash` matcher, refuses a pathspec-less
  commit that would carry a foreign staged path, refuses `git add -A` / `.` /
  bare `-u` / `git commit -a`, and refuses a bare `git stash` over uncommitted
  work. 50 tests in `tests/unit/test_checkout_guard.py`, all passing.

  The three checks that make that a measurement rather than a claim:

  | check | result |
  |---|---|
  | guard disabled, suite re-run (restore verified byte-for-byte, by copy — not `git stash`) | **15 failed**; with the guard, 50 pass |
  | mutation rounds, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, each pattern asserted unique | every surviving mutant either equivalent or turned into a new test |
  | the hook run from `PATH` against this repository | `git add -A` → exit 2 with the remedy; `ls -la` → exit 0, silent |

  Two real gaps were found by the mutation rounds and closed, **both permissive**:
  `git commit --all` had no test (the `-a` shorthand was caught by a second branch
  that masked it), and a bare `git stash push` read its own subcommand as a
  pathspec and was allowed.

  A third was found by the tests themselves: the hook's top-level filter was
  anchored to the start of a command, so `xargs git add` never entered the guard
  at all.

  **What this does NOT cover, stated because a completeness claim is a
  measurement:** a working-tree modification cannot be attributed to a session by
  this mechanism — file edits do not arrive as shell commands — so the stash
  refusal is unconditional on the command's shape rather than attributed. And the
  index-delta attribution has a race the width of one `git add`, which errs
  permissive; it is commented where it is computed.

### B-34 — the session record's `sessionId` goes stale, so the fleet measures a dead log with `binding_confirmed: true`

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by the user, who saw PM mode present an agent whose own
  screen said it was working (*"akkor is odarakta amikor meg dolgozik"*)
- **measured:** pid 113100's record `~/.claude/sessions/113100.json` names
  `sessionId 83de5d69…` with `updatedAt` 12:18:48; the terminal's own status line
  says `e96872a1…`, and on disk `83de5d69….jsonl` is 97 KB last written 21:17:47
  while `e96872a1….jsonl` is 4.4 MB last written 21:32:01 — 75 s before the check.
  The state endpoint reports `binding_confirmed: true` and
  `last_movement_seconds: 902` for a session that moved 75 s ago.
- **the direction that costs:** the binding is confidently wrong rather than
  absent. `_session_log_for()` deliberately has no "newest log in this project"
  fallback (measured 4 correct of 9), so a missing record is reported as missing —
  but a STALE record is not missing, and nothing downstream can tell.
- **why it goes stale:** a session that continues past a compact or a resume opens
  a new transcript under a new id; the per-pid record keeps the id it was written
  with. One record per pid, so there is nothing to disambiguate — the newer id is
  simply never recorded.
- **fixed when:** for every live agent, `state.session_log`'s basename equals the
  session id the process is actually writing, checked against the newest transcript
  that names that pid's cwd — and a record whose named log has not moved while a
  newer one in the same project has is reported as unconfirmed rather than
  confirmed.
- **note:** `fleet-pm-mode` does not depend on this being fixed. Its own filter
  (`who_has_the_floor()`) excludes an agent that owes the next utterance, and both
  logs here fail that test — but that is a second, independent reason, not a repair.

### B-33 — PM mode presents an agent it cannot show and cannot address, and then the full screen is empty

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by the user, with a screenshot — *"PM Mode bekapcsolva
  es nem jon be afelulet"*.
- **measured, in the browser** (`localhost:7400`, PM mode on, 1516×784 viewport):
  the overlay renders — header, counts, footer buttons are all there — and the
  content area is **two lines of text over ~700 px of black**: *"The framework
  holds no terminal for this agent…"* and *"no input: this session has no seat on
  the messaging bus"*. `web/src/components/FleetPm.tsx:295` is the branch: when
  `agent.terminal_label` is null it renders a heading, a warning and `FleetInstruct`
  — and `FleetInstruct` returns a single grey line when there is no seat
  (`web/src/components/FleetInstruct.tsx:174`). Nothing else.
- **measured, that there IS something to show:** for the presented pid the log
  endpoint returns a full conversation —
  `curl -s localhost:7400/api/fleet/agents/<pid>/log?limit=8` → 8 turns with text,
  and the fleet payload carries `excerpt` and `excerpt_from` for the same agent.
  So the emptiness is the surface's, not the agent's.
- **measured, how ordinary this is:** `/api/fleet/agents` → **3 of 20** live agents
  have `terminal_label: null` (`population: foreign` — the framework did not start
  them), and **2 of the 4** currently queued by PM mode are among them. This is not
  an edge case; it is half the queue.
- **the same finding already exists one screen over, and was fixed there:** B-10,
  *"nem hiszem hogy üres kellene legyen akár egy agent is, már biztosan van róla
  valami log, info"* — the fix was `TileActivity` (`web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx:501`),
  which renders the log where the tile would otherwise be blank. PM mode never got
  it, and PM mode is the surface where the emptiness costs most: it is full screen,
  so there is nothing else on it.
- **⚠ a second defect, narrower, NOT fixed by the above:** the queue does not
  consider whether an item can be answered at all. Measured on the same snapshot:
  `/api/fleet/pm` presented pid 3202485 (no pty, no bus seat — nothing the reader
  can do) while the queue also held 113100 (`set-core-bugfix`) and 183020
  (a consumer project's session), both with a terminal. A mode whose promise is
  *"whichever is waiting on you"* spent the screen on the one item that cannot be
  answered. Ordering is `lib/set_orch/fleet/attention.py`; changing it is a
  contract change and is deliberately not folded into the display fix.
- **fixed when:** with PM mode on and a terminal-less agent presented, the content
  area shows that agent's conversation (turns from the log endpoint, or the reason
  the log could not be read — never a blank), verified BY LOOKING at
  `localhost:7400` in the browser, plus a unit test that renders `FleetPm` with a
  terminal-less presented agent and asserts the log rows are there.

### B-36 — an engine call without a change silently burns every pending answer

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-21, by an adversarial review of
  `work-cycle-question-outbound`, and **reproduced independently** before entry.
- **measured:** `open_engine(tree, change="")` leaves `tasks_path` as `None`, so
  `_awaiting_keys` returns an empty set (`lib/set_workcycle/cli.py:82-85`). In
  `connector.intake` the guard is `if awaiting_keys and key not in awaiting_keys`
  (`lib/set_workcycle/connector.py:318`) — an empty set is falsy, so the guard is
  skipped and **every** answer is applied and consumption-stamped. Back in
  `cli.py:125` the release is gated on `if tasks_path is not None`, which on that
  path it is not: nothing is cleared, nothing is recorded. The same happens on the
  not-adopted early return, which calls `intake(root)` with no `awaiting` at all
  (`cli.py:102`). Reproduced on a throwaway tree:

  ```
  answer written:            human--20260821T000746.json
  intake(tree)            →  ['applied my-change#3.1 (from human)']
  intake(tree, awaiting=…) →  ['no answers were pending']
  consumed:                  ['human--20260821T000746.json']
  ```

- **why it is severe:** the task stays `- [?]` for ever, the group it holds never
  becomes runnable, and the person's answer is unrecoverable through the normal
  path — while the command **prints `applied …`**. It fails in the reassuring
  direction twice: the operator sees success, and the engine reports a calm it has
  not verified. Any read-only invocation without `--change` is enough.
- **⚠ what a fix must NOT do:** it must not make an empty `awaiting` set mean
  "match everything". The correct reading is "we do not know what is awaited",
  which is not the same as "nothing is awaited" — the false-absence class. Nor may
  it quarantine or delete: the answer belongs where it is until it can be applied.
- **fixed when:** an intake that cannot determine the awaiting set applies nothing
  and consumes nothing; a later call that can determine it applies the answer; and
  a test asserts the FIRST call left the file unconsumed — asserting only that the
  second call works would pass on the broken code too.
- **belongs to:** the code shipped by `work-cycle-engine-apply-first`.

### B-37 — an answer's `source` field reaches the log raw, and it is written off-machine

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by an adversarial review.
- **measured:** `cli.py:130-131` logs
  `"released %s — an answer arrived from %s"` with `applied.source` taken verbatim
  from the answer document (`connector.py:303-305`, no validation, no bound).
  `answer_filename` sanitises `source` for the FILENAME (`connector.py:141-152`)
  and nothing sanitises it for the log. Once answers can be written by a party off
  this machine — which is what the question bridge introduces — that is
  arbitrary, unbounded, externally-chosen text in the framework's journal.
- **why it is a defect and not a nit:** the framework's own rule is *shape, counts
  and error classes only* (`lib/set_orch/project_status.py:23`). The enumeration
  missed this field because it names "the question and the answer", and `source`
  is neither — the same shape as the defect that rule's own docstring describes.
- **fixed when:** `source` is bounded and sanitised before it reaches a log line,
  and a test feeds a hostile `source` and asserts what the journal contains.

### B-38 — an answer is interpolated into a full-session prompt as a standing instruction

- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by an adversarial review, with the security lens.
- **measured:** `lib/set_workcycle/prompt.py:95-101` renders answers as
  `f"- **{task}**: {answer}"` under the heading *"Questions that have been
  answered"*, followed by *"They are decided now — act on them rather than asking
  again."* No fencing, no escaping, no length bound. That string becomes
  `cmd += ["--", prompt]` for `claude -p` running as **a full session** with the
  project's own hooks and permission mode (`lib/set_workcycle/runner.py:60-81`),
  in the project's tree, unattended.
- **why the severity changes now:** today an answer can only be written by
  somebody already on the machine. The question bridge is precisely the mechanism
  that extends that write surface to whoever can post in a chat channel. An answer
  reading *"…also run: …"* is indistinguishable from a decision a person made, and
  every gate and test still passes — the injected instruction IS the work product.
- **fixed when:** answer text is delimited where it lands and bounded in length;
  where the question offered a closed option set, an answer outside that set is
  refused rather than pasted; and a test asserts that an answer containing
  instruction-shaped text does not change what the unit is told to do.
- **belongs to:** the code shipped by `work-cycle-engine-apply-first`; it is a
  precondition for `work-cycle-question-outbound`, not a task inside it.

### B-39 — `mark_awaiting` silently fails on the ordinary file shape, and its failure empties the register

- **state:** open · **⚠ severity: this is the most serious entry in this file**
- **reported:** 2026-08-21 by an adversarial review, **reproduced independently** before entry.
- **measured:** `_task_line_re` (`lib/set_workcycle/connector.py:347`) opens with
  `(?P<indent>\s*)`, and `\s` matches a newline. When a blank line precedes the task —
  **the shape of every `tasks.md` in this repository** — the match starts on that
  newline and the rewrite lands on the wrong line. Reproduced:

  | file | `mark_awaiting` returned | `awaiting_tasks` |
  |---|---|---|
  | blank line before the task | `True` | `[]` |
  | no blank line | `True` | `[('1.1', 'plain question')]` |

  In the first case the comment is written onto the heading line, the blank line is
  eaten, and the task is never marked.

- **why it is the worst one here:** the failure does not stop at the register. With no
  awaiting task, `_awaiting_keys` returns an empty set, and `intake`'s guard is
  `if awaiting_keys and key not in awaiting_keys` — falsy, so **every pending answer for
  any change is applied and stamped consumed**, while `clear_awaiting` fails and nothing
  is recorded. The answer's text is destroyed. This is B-36 reached by a second route,
  and the cycle prints `marked 1.1 as awaiting a person` and then `applied …` while
  neither happened. Reassuring direction, twice.
- **fixed when:** marking a task with a blank line before it produces `- [?]` on that
  task and leaves the blank line alone; `awaiting_tasks` finds it; and a test uses a
  file with a blank line, because the file shape IS the reproducer.

### B-40 — an intake pass that found an already-consumed document reports that it found nothing

- **state:** open
- **reported / reproduced:** 2026-08-21.
- **measured:** `IntakeResult.as_lines()` (`connector.py:187-196`) renders applied,
  unmatched, superseded, deferred and quarantined — `already_consumed` is collected at
  `connector.py:268` and **never rendered**, so the list falls through to its
  `["no answers were pending"]` default. Reproduced: second pass returns
  `already_consumed: ['chat--…json']` and `lines: ['no answers were pending']`.
- **why it matters:** `intake_lines` is the only thing `EngineView` carries out, so this
  is what an operator sees. The dataclass docstring says *"Every category is reported;
  none is silent"* — the comment is false, which is the shape the rules name: a comment
  is a claim, not a measurement.
- **fixed when:** a pass that saw an already-consumed document says so, and a test
  asserts the second pass does not say "no answers were pending".

### B-41 — a superseded answer is applied on the next pass

- **state:** open
- **reported / reproduced:** 2026-08-21.
- **measured:** `intake` stamps only the newest answer as consumed
  (`connector.py:315-325`); the superseded ones are left unconsumed and in place.
  Reproduced: pass 1 → `applied ['MASODIK'] superseded ['ELSO']`; pass 2 →
  `applied ['ELSO']`.
- **why it matters:** the same task asked a second question later becomes awaiting again,
  and the stale answer silently releases it and reaches the next unit's prompt as the
  person's decision. `retained` was meant to mean *kept, not acted on*.
- **fixed when:** a superseded answer is retained and never applied on a later pass, and
  a test runs intake twice.

### B-42 — answer ordering is decided by a field the answer's own author chooses

- **state:** open
- **reported / reproduced:** 2026-08-21.
- **measured:** `connector.py:316` sorts by `(written_at, filename)` and `written_at` is
  read straight off the document (`connector.py:306`). Reproduced: an answer stamped
  `9999-01-01` beat a real one and the real one was reported as
  `superseded — retained, a newer answer won`.
- **why it matters now:** while only somebody at this machine can write an answer this is
  a footgun. `work-cycle-question-outbound` is the change that extends the write surface
  to whoever can post in a chat channel, where "post first with a future date" wins every
  race against the person the question was put to — and the log line states the opposite.
- **fixed when:** ordering uses a time the receiving side observed, or the document's own
  time is bounded to a sane window and the log says which was used.

### B-43 — the question text can write new task lines into the project's task file

- **state:** open
- **reported / reproduced:** 2026-08-21.
- **measured:** the question comes from a unit's verdict, is `.strip()`ed and nothing else
  (`verdict.py:158`), and is embedded in a single-line HTML comment
  (`connector.py:370`). Reproduced with a question containing `-->` and a newline:

  ```
  - [?] 1.1 real <!-- awaiting: ok -->
  - [ ] 9.9 INJEKTALT TASZK -->
  - [ ] 1.2 other
  ```

  `9.9` is now a real, parsed task in that group.
- **why it matters:** the awaiting task is the register every other mechanism derives
  from. A register the unit can forge makes the derivation worthless — and the question
  is also what an outbound would carry to a person, in the unit's words.
- **fixed when:** a question containing a newline or a comment terminator cannot add,
  alter or remove a line, and a test uses exactly those two characters.

### B-44 — `change` and `task` reach a filesystem path unvalidated

- **state:** open
- **reported / reproduced:** 2026-08-21.
- **measured:** `record_answer` interpolates `change` into
  `set/runtime/work-cycle/{change}/answers.jsonl` (`connector.py:421,427`) and
  `open_engine` builds `base / change / "tasks.md"` (`cli.py:112`). Reproduced:
  `record_answer(tree, "../../../ESCAPED", …)` wrote to
  `…/set/runtime/work-cycle/../../../ESCAPED/answers.jsonl`. Both values arrive from
  `--change` / `--task` on `cmd_answer` (`cli.py:563-567`), which is the entry point an
  answer bridge would drive from message text.
- **why the enumeration missed it:** the rule that covers these fields is scoped to log
  lines. The right instrument was aimed at the wrong surface — the question is not only
  *does this field reach a diagnostic* but *where does this field land*.
- **fixed when:** a path built from either field is refused unless it resolves inside the
  tree, and a test passes a traversal in each.


## Closed

### B-80 — six recorded entries share one label, and only their age tells them apart

- **state:** closed (`ceecdeb5`) — change `fleet-recorded-session-peek`
- **reported:** 2026-08-26 by this session, LOOKING at the restore disclosure after
  `fleet-restore-last-composition` shipped
- **measured:** on the live record, one project's 49 entries include **six** rows reading
  `set-core-bugfix2` — `last seen 15.1h / 36.6h / 2.0d / 2.0d / 2.8d / 3.9d ago` — and a second
  label repeats five times. The cause is structural and correct: an entry is keyed on the session
  id and a `--resume` mints a new one, so one named agent accumulates one entry per resume.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** in the *unactionable* direction rather than the
  acting one — the list is honest, and nobody can choose from it. Two rows two days apart carrying
  the same name is exactly the state where a person picks the wrong conversation to resume, and
  the screen gave them no way to know. Deliberately left out of
  `fleet-restore-last-composition` (see its `design.md`, "Open Questions"): collapsing the
  duplicates changes what the RECORD means, which is a different act from fixing what restore
  offers.
- **closed with:** `groupByLabel()` renders a repeated label as **one lineage** stating how many
  conversations it holds and the newest one's age, opening to the individual entries — each still
  separately selectable, because an act that restored a lineage as a unit would start six
  conversations of one agent at once. And the discriminator the entries lacked now exists: a
  per-entry `what was this?` reads the last turns of that conversation from its own transcript
  through `GET /api/fleet/roster/{project}/{key}/peek` — nothing started, nothing resumed, nothing
  written down. Verified on the live record against a second instance: 47 flat rows became five
  lineages plus the singles, and a peek rendered `the last 6 turns of 92 — earlier ones are still
  in the transcript`. 18 new tests, all 18 failing without the source.
- **fixed when:** a repeated label renders as one lineage the reader can open — the resumes of one
  agent, newest first — or each row carries something besides its age that distinguishes it
  (first-seen, a transcript size, the last thing it was doing). Held by a test over a record with
  five same-label entries asserting the surface renders one group rather than five equal rows.

### B-78 — the restore offer is built from 30 days of HISTORY, so it promises back conversations nobody had open

- **state:** closed (`da98ddf7` core, `f6bc0166` surface, `a7f5ee6b` the height fix the look found) — change `fleet-restore-last-composition`
- **reported:** 2026-08-26 by the user, with a screenshot of the fleet screen: the header read
  `Restore 9 of 24 — 3 already running, 12 cannot be resumed`, and the ask was that restore
  offer *what is open now*, not everything.
- **measured:** the roster is an accumulating record — `RETENTION_SECONDS = 30 * 24 * 3600`
  (`lib/set_orch/fleet/roster.py:71`) — and `restore()` attempts **every** recorded entry for
  the project (`lib/set_orch/fleet/restore.py:161`, `for entry in entries`). Counted on this
  machine's own `fleet-roster.json`, comparing every entry against those seen in the LAST
  discovery round:

  ```
  projects: 18   recorded entries: 233   seen in the last round: 13
  worst single project: 109 recorded,  4 open
  the screenshotted one:  24 recorded,  3 open
  ```

  The duplication is not noise: one named agent accumulates one entry per `--resume`, because
  the key is the session id. In the screenshotted project a single label held **five** recorded
  session ids, of which one is the live conversation.
- **why it matters, and which way it fails:** in the direction that ACTS. The button's number is
  honest about what the code will do, and what the code will do is start nine sessions the user
  did not leave open — on a project where a mis-aimed click has already cost 21 started agents
  (`web/src/components/FleetRestore.tsx`, the `armed` note). "Everything ever recorded" and
  "the composition I had" are different sets, and only the second is what a restore means.
- **closed with:** the roster document now carries `last_round_at`, stamped by the write that
  stamps every entry that round saw, so "was open" is an exact equality rather than a time window;
  `read()` reports `in_last_round` per entry (`None`, never `False`, when the record cannot say);
  `restore()` takes an optional key selection where absent, empty and populated are three
  different requests. On the live record the same project now reads **24 recorded, 3 in the last
  round** — and on screen, `All 3 already running` instead of `Restore 9 of 24`. Verified in the
  browser, not only by test: 11 Python tests of which 10 fail without the source, 13 web tests all
  13 failing without it, and a baseline set diff (0 leaks) showing no new failure.
- **fixed when:** the offer's default set is the last observed COMPOSITION — the entries seen in
  the final discovery round before the fleet went down — with the recorded-but-not-open remainder
  reachable behind an expander, never silently dropped. Held by a test over a roster document
  whose entries carry three different `last_seen` rounds: the offer counts only the newest round,
  and the full list is still readable. A round with no entries must read as *"nothing was open
  when the fleet was last seen"*, not as the previous round's composition.

### B-29 — the terminal's last row is cut in half, and the last row is the status bar

- **state:** closed (see the verification at the end of this entry)
- **reported:** 2026-08-20 by the user, with a screenshot of the enlarged agent
  view — *"a terminal aljan a status rész szétesik"*.
- **measured:** a Playwright sweep of the viewport height against the live
  server, one framework-owned terminal open in the enlarged view. TWO
  independent mechanisms, both of which cut the LAST row and only the last row:

  | viewport | what the measurement says | last row visible |
  |---|---|---|
  | 520 px | `.xterm-screen` is **2 px taller than the host's client box** | 12 / 14 px |
  | 440 px | the card overflows the window by **19 px** | 4 / 14 px |
  | 400 px and below | overflows by 59–99 px | **0 / 14 px** |

  - **The 2 px** is the host's own border. `FitAddon` derives the row count from
    the outer box, so `border` (1 px top + 1 px bottom) is not subtracted: a
    224 px host has a 222 px client box, and 16 rows × 14 px = 224. At heights
    that land just under a row multiple it hands back one row more than fits.
  - **The overflow** is `min-h-[12rem]` on the terminal host meeting
    `overflow: hidden` on the enlarged card. Ancestor walk at 440 px:
    `[data-fleet-terminal]` `clientHeight 180` vs `scrollHeight 228`, inside
    `[data-fleet-enlarged]` `clientHeight 289` vs `scrollHeight 321`,
    `overflow: hidden/hidden`. The page itself cannot scroll to it —
    `document.scrollHeight == innerHeight` — so the rows are not merely below the
    fold, they are unreachable.

- **why it is not cosmetic:** a terminal program puts its status line on its last
  row. Cutting the last row is therefore not "losing a row", it is losing the one
  row that says what the agent is doing and what it is waiting for. And it fails
  in the reassuring direction: the terminal above it looks completely normal.

- **⚠ what a fix must NOT do:** it must not resolve the conflict by making the
  card scroll. That keeps the floor and puts the status bar below a fold the
  reader has to discover — the exact shape `ui-quality.md` forbids, *compaction
  must never hide a failure*. A short terminal is honest; a truncated one is not.
  The floor's own argument does not carry over from `MIN_COLS` either: a narrow
  terminal destroys a layout the program composed for N columns, while a short
  one only means fewer rows and a repaint.

- **fixed when:** at every viewport height in the sweep, the last rendered row is
  fully visible — its full cell height, inside both the host's client box and the
  window — and an e2e test asserts it by measuring rendered pixels, not by
  checking that a fit function ran.

- **fixed / verified 2026-08-20:** `web/tests/e2e/fleet-terminal-fits.spec.ts`,
  against the live server with a framework-owned agent this spec starts and stops
  itself. Two changes in `web/src/components/FleetTerminal.tsx`, and **each was
  mutation-tested separately, because either one alone leaves half the defect**:

  | | before | mutate the flex basis back | mutate the fit check out | both in place |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 520 px | 12/14 px | 14/14 | **12/14 px** | 14/14 |
  | 440 px | 4/14 px | **4/14 px** | 14/14 | 14/14 |
  | 400 px | 0/14 px | **0/14 px** | 14/14 | 14/14 |

  - `refit()` now checks the RESULT of the fit — it measures the rendered
    `.xterm-screen` against the host's client box and drops a row when the fit
    handed back one more than fits. Measured against what was rendered rather
    than recomputed from the box: the cell height is xterm's, and a second copy
    of that arithmetic would be a second place to drift.
  - `flex-1 min-h-[12rem]` became `flex-[1_1_12rem] min-h-0`. The same 12 rem is
    now a *preference* rather than a floor: it still contributes 192 px to a
    content-sized grid card, and it yields in the enlarged card instead of
    pushing the terminal's bottom out of a `overflow: hidden` chain.

  The terminal gets short rather than truncated, which is the point — measured at
  the smallest height in the sweep it still renders 7 rows with the status line
  fully visible. The restore after each mutation was grep-verified, not assumed.

### B-7 — the layout control was overruled by whichever panels happened to be open
- **state:** closed (`038c39e3`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user — *"column most itt a második rowt
  változtatta csak hogy hány oszlopot akarok jobb felső kapcsolónál és nem az
  összeset?"*, with a screenshot showing three stacked full-width tiles while 3
  columns was selected.
- **measured:** a tile with an open log or terminal carried `md:col-span-full`
  (`wide`), so with two of three tiles holding something open, choosing three
  columns re-laid out exactly one tile. The rule was there to stop ragged rows —
  obsolete once the rows became uniform.
- **fixed when / verified:** 1900×1100, three agents — choosing 3 gives 3 distinct
  column positions at 449 px each, choosing 2 gives 2 at 678 px.
- **reported together with:** the same message asked for the control to be drawn
  rather than numbered (*"oszlop 1,2,3,4 helyett ikonok kellenek amin látszik hogy
  hogy fog kinézni! layout ikonok"*). Done in the same commit — all four buttons
  render an SVG glyph and no digit, with the count kept in the label and in
  `data-fleet-columns`.

### B-0 — the right-hand panel left 59–73 % of the screen empty, and maximise stopped short of the bottom
- **state:** closed (`c4f4842f`)
- **reported:** 2026-08-19 by the user twice in their own words (*"nem használjuk
  ki a helyet jobb oldalt … azt akarom fixen legyen értelmes ablak mérete az
  agenteknek"*, *"agent maximize nem nyitja ki teljesen az aljáig az ablakot"*),
  and by this session earlier as a screen-review finding that was handed on and
  never done.
- **measured before:** 1900×1100 — content ended at 450 px in an 1100 px panel with
  five agents (59 % empty) and at 292 px with two (73 %); tile heights
  119/127/95/95/111.
- **measured after:** the grid spans 85→1088, `scrollHeight === clientHeight === 1003`
  (no gap), three tiles at 498 px each and equal; maximised card 85→1088 with the
  remaining 12 px being the panel's own padding.
- **the cause, for the next reader:** the panel was `overflow-y-auto`, so it had no
  height to give, and every tile sized itself from its own text while the terminal
  took a guessed `62vh`.

### B-129 — the usage strip renders an arbitrary 10px font size, breaking the design-drift gate on main
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by the board-strip session, running the design-drift suite
  while wiring the fleet board strip.
- **measured:** `cd web && npx vitest run tests/unit/designDrift.test.ts` —
  "carries no arbitrary font size" fails with exactly one hit:
  `components/FleetUsageStrip.tsx:113: <span className="text-[10px] text-fg-ghost shrink-0"`.
  Introduced by `15d06462` ("feat(usage): a short label before each compact usage bar
  pair"); the file is otherwise clean at HEAD. Pre-existing, not caused by the strip.
- **what proves it fixed:** the same vitest file passes; `git grep -n 'text-\[10px\]' web/src`
  returns nothing.

### B-130 — the Fleet page suites flake under the in-flight agent-tree work, and the failing test MOVES between runs
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by the board-strip session while wiring the fleet board
  strip — it initially looked like the strip's fault, which is exactly why it is
  written down.
- **measured:** `cd web && npx vitest run tests/unit/fleetSurface.test.tsx
  tests/unit/fleetArrangement.test.tsx` run three times in minutes — different
  tests fail each time (task 7.4 enlarged-toggle, "drops the phase", "renders a
  waiting agent"), and the same failures occur with the strip **fully reverted**
  from `Fleet.tsx` (revert → run → re-apply, no stash). Isolated single-file runs
  also fail, so it is not parallel-file load. The working tree carries uncommitted
  `FleetProjectColumn.tsx` / `fleetTypes.ts` edits (the agent branch/worktree line)
  — the likely cause, still being written.
- **what proves it fixed:** those two files pass on three consecutive runs once the
  agent-tree work is committed; if they still flake then, the cause is elsewhere.

### B-131 — `tsc -b` fails on main: unused release-membership scaffolding in `FleetBoard.tsx`
- **state:** closed (fixed by wiring — the "wire them" branch of the report's own fork)
- **closed:** 2026-08-30; the release-selector work wired both symbols (`setReleaseChoice` drives the selector, `offBoardItems` renders the off-board group). Evidence: `cd web && npx tsc -b` exits with 0 lines of output at commit `306b1e5b`; the symbols are read in `FleetBoard.tsx` (selector + off-board group) and asserted by `fleetBoard.test.tsx` 30/30.
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by the release-prep session while typechecking before a push.
- **measured:** `cd web && npx tsc -b` — two TS6133 errors at HEAD:
  `src/components/FleetBoard.tsx:480` (`setReleaseChoice` declared but never read) and
  `:486` (`offBoardItems` declared but never read). The file is untouched by the working
  tree at report time, so the errors are committed content. NOT verified against the
  parallel session's intent: the symbols look like the release-membership scaffolding that
  session is expected to wire next, so the fix may be "wire them", not "delete them".
- **note:** `tsc --noEmit` is blind here — only `tsc -b` measures (known property of this
  tree), which is why a fully-green commit sequence still carries this.
- **fixed when:** `npx tsc -b` on main exits clean, either by wiring or removing the two
  symbols, with the owning session's consent.

### B-132 — a dock/undock click before `loadDocks` resolves writes the stale list over the server
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by the misrender investigation (measured while probing, then reproduced by the probe itself).
- **measured:** `GET /api/fleet/layout` takes ~30-35 s (it runs discovery). Until it resolves, the page's dock list is the local default; any dock/undock click in that window calls `writeDocks` with the STALE list (`Fleet.tsx:2071-2075`, `loadDocks` lands late at `:2059`), silently deleting docked panels. During investigation the probe's click deleted the user's persisted files dock (`docks.consumer-app`). Same "late answer overwrites a click" class as `wiresTouched` (`Fleet.tsx:2019-2025`).
- **what proves it fixed:** a dock click issued while the layout request is still in flight survives the request's resolution — the clicked dock is still present in `docks` after `loadDocks` lands.

### B-133 — one session-drift agent crashes the whole wire endpoint: "no wire" meant "the view is dead"
- **state:** closed
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by the user — "there is no wire right now" on the fleet screen; measured by this session.
- **measured:** `GET /api/fleet/channels` returned **HTTP 500** on every poll. Traceback (journalctl, set-web): `KeyError: '<session-uuid>'` at `fleet/channels.py` in `derive_channel_graph`'s rooms loop — `seat_by_session[str(node.session_id)]`. An agent joined through the unique-project-root fallback (session id absent from the roster, exactly one seat sharing its project root) gets `enrolled=True` with a session id that has NO roster entry, and the rooms loop keyed by session id — a guaranteed KeyError on exactly the case the fallback exists for. The 500 took down the wire payload for the whole fleet; the screen showed no wires at all. Found because the user asked for a LIVE test of the wire view (connect two agents) — the API was asked before any agents were connected.
- **fail direction:** silent and total — not a missing wire but a dead endpoint, dressed as an empty view.
- **fixed:** rooms loop resolves the seat by NAME (`node.seat`, set on both join paths) instead of by session id; regression test feeds a fallback-joined agent WITH a session id and asserts a real edge. Stash-and-rerun proven with the change's own new tests: the crash case reproduces on the old loop by construction (KeyError) and passes fixed; channels suite 24/24.
- **fixed when:** met — endpoint 200s with the fallback-joined agent live in the fleet.

### B-134 — a live session's own tile stays seat-less: sac's session suffix is not the harness session id, so the sanctioned join misses
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-08-30 by this session, while wiring the fleet wire view live.
- **measured:** the fleet discovery lists this session (pid 2445628, harness session id `2854f26e-8abe-…`, tile `set-core-subproject-lines`) with `seat=null`; the bus roster holds the SAME session as `set-core#e832b7ce` (`sac whoami`: "writer: set-core#e832b7ce (this session)"; `sac agents --json` contains `e832b7ce`). The join in `fleet/channels.py` keys the roster by harness session id, so a seat whose suffix derives from something other than the harness uuid never joins — the tile reads "no seat on the messaging bus", its writes reach the bus (channel file created in `channels/wpc-board/`) but never light up its own node. Sibling sessions whose sac suffix DOES match their harness id (e.g. `set-core#547efd3b` ↔ node `547efd3b-09c8…`) join fine, which is why the drift is invisible most of the time.
- **fail direction:** false absence on the live view plus a misleading "no seat" instruction — the seat exists; the two identity systems disagree about the id.
- **fixed when:** a live session whose sac seat exists joins its own node regardless of which id each system derived, with a test feeding a roster whose session id differs from the discovery session id.

### B-135 — reported "fleet terminal copy-paste does not work, even with Shift" — the whole chain verifies green in headless Chromium, so the failure is environment-specific and not yet localised
- **state:** closed — narrowed 2026-09-01 to the Ctrl+Shift+C key, which the panel does not own and cannot own
- **reported:** 2026-09-01 by the user — *"copy-paste terminalbol megint nem mukodik. shift-tel sem"*, then "fleet copy paste nem mukodik".
- **measured (2026-09-01, headless Chromium via Playwright, against the LIVE dashboard on :7400, agent `set-core-1126`):** every step of the B-60…B-65 chain works — the mouse-taken marker shows; **Shift+drag selects** (green selection layer visible, 54 chars); **Ctrl+C with a selection announces "copied 54 chars" and the browser clipboard provably holds the selected text** (read back after a sentinel was planted); the Copy button with nothing selected correctly announces "not copied: nothing is selected"; **Ctrl+V and Ctrl+Shift+V both deliver the clipboard text into the agent's prompt** (verified on screen: four probe strings landed in the TUI input line, none prevented, target `xterm-helper-textarea`, focus correct after attach). Note: the first attach takes ~13 s on a cold page load (dynamic xterm chunks) — earlier "connecting…" readings were that, not a hang. Side effect of the probes, disclosed: the probe strings `AAA-paste-one` … `DDD-paste-four` sit in `set-core-1126`'s prompt buffer (never sent — no Enter).
- **measured again the same day, REAL Google Chrome (Playwright `channel: 'chrome'`, headed, the user's own X11 desktop, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11` verified on gnome-shell):** clean A/B with no external clipboard writes in between — **Ctrl+C AND the panel Copy button both write the selected text into the X11 SYSTEM clipboard**, read back with `xclip -selection clipboard -o` (23 chars, matching the selection, for both paths; green notice both times). An earlier reading that seemed to show the button leaving the clipboard empty was the test's own `xclip` sentinel-plant racing (confound discarded — the planting demonstrably failed in the same run). End-to-end verdict: select → copy (both gestures) → system clipboard → paste all verify green in the user's browser class, on the user's machine, against the live server.
- **fail direction:** unknown until the user's exact step, browser and origin are named — the mechanism cannot be called broken from here; a report that contradicts a green measurement means the measurement covered the wrong environment, not that the report is wrong.
- **what would localise it:** (a) which step fails — select / copy / paste; (b) what the terminal's header row says after the attempt — green "copied N chars", amber "not copied: …", or nothing at all (the three outcomes point at three different layers); (c) browser and origin — answered 2026-09-01: Chrome, this machine, `localhost:7400`; (d) whether the tab predates the last `web/dist` rebuild — a stale tab is the B-77 shape (missing lazy chunks, silent failure) and is now the leading suspect, since the mechanism verifies green from a FRESH page; a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) is the discriminating step. Also live: `Ctrl+Shift+C` opens Chrome's DevTools and never reaches the page (B-63) — "even with shift" matches that key exactly; the copy key is plain `Ctrl+C` with a selection.
- **resolved:** the user confirmed the failing gesture the same day — *"ctrl-shuft- coundt work it opens the chrome debug"*. The copy key they were reaching for was `Ctrl+Shift+C`, which Chrome claims for DevTools before the page sees any keystroke; that is exactly the B-63 measurement, and it is why B-63 moved copy onto plain `Ctrl+C` with a selection. No panel change: every surface that teaches the key (the Copy button's accessible name, the tooltip) already says `Ctrl+C`; `isCopyRequest` still accepts `Ctrl+Shift+C` for browsers that do not claim it, and leaving that is deliberate.
- **closed when:** met — the report is narrowed to the key Chrome owns, and the mechanism was verified green twice in the user's own browser class on the live server.

### B-136 — the task 7.4 tab-strip tests in `fleetSurface.test.tsx` are flaky: the enlarge control is sometimes not in the DOM when the click fires
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-05 by a peer session reading the full-suite results, then verified and narrowed by this session.
- **measured:** `npx vitest run tests/unit/fleetSurface.test.tsx -t "one tile enlarged"` fails on COMMITTED code, repeatedly, in both worlds: with the tab-strip/maximise change (`736d6182`) 1–2 of 3 tests fail per run; with `736d6182`'s Fleet.tsx swapped out for its predecessor (`HEAD~1`) 1–3 of 3 fail per run — so the flake predates that change and is not caused by it. Failure shape: `Unable to fire a "click" event - please provide a DOM element` at the `fireEvent.click(container.querySelector('[data-fleet-enlarged-toggle…]'))` line — the control is queried without a `waitFor` and is not there yet. In FULL-suite runs the same tests pass or fail run-to-run on identical code (measured across four runs), which is why the suite sometimes reports them green. The enlarged-tile click is also the pivot of the maximise work, so this flake keeps implicating whichever change last touched the strip.
- **fail direction:** intermittent red that reads as a regression by whoever touched the area last — and therefore risks training everybody to ignore the suite.
- **fixed when:** the click is waited on (`waitFor`/`findBy`, or the control's arrival asserted before firing), and the three tests pass in isolation N runs in a row (say 5) on committed code, in both the current head and its predecessor.

### B-137 — full-suite runs mask deterministic failures: tests that fail 3/3 in isolation pass in some full-suite runs
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-05 by this session, while setting a failure baseline for the maximise work (the peer session's report prompted the isolation runs).
- **measured:** `tests/unit/fleetPanels.test.ts` "is exactly this list" (the KNOWN_PANEL_KINDS change-detector) failed 3/3 isolation runs while `PANEL_BOARD` was already committed (since 2026-08-30) — the detector was RED and the drift survived five days. In full-suite runs the same test failed once and PASSED in at least two later runs on identical code. `tests/unit/designDrift.test.ts` behaves the same: deterministic red in isolation (2/2), absent from some full-suite failure sets (run 4 of 2026-09-05: 3 failures, neither file among them). So a full-suite green is NOT evidence for these files; only isolation runs decide. Root cause NOT yet measured — candidate class is test-order/module-state pollution (FleetBoard's module-level `declaresCache` and localStorage-carrying fleet tests run in the same worker pool); entered as the measured behaviour, not the guessed cause.
- **fail direction:** the reassuring one — a deterministic, real defect reads as green depending on what ran before it.
- **fixed when:** a deterministic test's verdict is the same in isolation and in the full suite, demonstrated by running the fleet unit files in both orders and getting identical failure sets twice; then the detector tests get a scheduled isolation run so a committed drift cannot again survive on suite-order luck.

### B-138 — designDrift: five off-scale font sizes in `FleetUsageStrip.tsx` and `FleetWirePanel.tsx`
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-05 by the peer session from a full-suite run; verified deterministic in isolation by this session (2/2 red) and confirmed pre-existing (fails on committed code untouched by that day's changes; neither file was modified by the maximise work).
- **measured:** `npx vitest run tests/unit/designDrift.test.ts` — "carries no arbitrary font size — the scale is 12/14/16" reports exactly 5 findings: `src/components/FleetUsageStrip.tsx:113` (`text-[10px]`), `src/components/FleetWirePanel.tsx:155` (`text-[10px]`), `:166`, `:345` (arbitrary-value classes), `:356` (`text-[10px]`). These are absolute sizes outside the declared 12/14/16 scale, so the smallest text on those two surfaces falls below the design system's floor and drifts from every other surface.
- **fixed when:** the findings list comes back empty (`expect(findings).toEqual([])` green in isolation), either by moving the sizes onto the scale or by a recorded, deliberate exception in the test — not by widening the assertion.

### B-139 — the fleet listing runs every project's status-contract subprocesses on a 30 s cycle even for projects with zero live agents: the refresh cost scales with the project roster, not the fleet
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-05 by the user ("how optimised is the resource handling, watching only live agents — can the fleet / base refresh eat less"), then measured by this session.
- **measured:** `curl -w %{time_total}` against the live server (port 7400): `GET /api/fleet/agents` takes **2.3–13.8 s** per call while the client polls it every 5 s (`web/src/pages/Fleet.tsx:2204`), and `GET /api/fleet/channels` takes 1.2–3.8 s on the same 5 s cycle. In-process profiling splits the cost: `discover_agents` + `read_state` for the 7 live agents is **0.09 s** — the live-agent half is already cheap and correct. The dominant term is `_declared_stage_axis` (`lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:378`), which resolves the status contract **for every project in the listing** (49 projects, only 2 of which publish contracts, and one of those has **zero live agents**) and runs each declared non-on-demand command — **24 subprocesses**, measured **25.9 s cold, ~26 s of toolchain work per 30 s TTL window** (`CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 30`, `api/project_status.py:36`). With a 5 s poll that is ~85 % duty cycle of the consumers' contract commands, which is exactly the observed 2–14 s latency. Secondary: `discover_projects` returns 49 projects against 7 live agents, and 7 roots fail `git worktree list` with exit 128 on every listing (repeated stderr spam).
- **fail direction:** the expensive direction — a screen nobody is looking at (no live agent in most projects) still keeps two projects' full contract toolchains running back-to-back; the cost is paid per known project, not per watched agent, so it grows with the roster while the screen's promise is "live agents".
- **fixed when:** with a browser open on the fleet screen, `/api/fleet/agents` answers in well under 1 s at the p95 and the contract-subprocess duty cycle drops to a small fraction — specifically: contract queries for projects with no live agents are skipped or served from a much longer TTL, the per-call subprocess work stays bounded regardless of roster size, and the same curl measurement over several minutes shows sustained sub-second answers (not just a warm first call).
- **addendum, same day — deeper measurement CORRECTS the attribution above, and finds the mechanism worse:**
  - *Which project costs what.* Per-command timing in-process: the contract project with **zero live agents costs 0.9 s per full cycle** (9 commands, all sub-second). The project with **2 live agents costs 39.3 s per full cycle** (15 commands: `snapshot` 15.0 s, `release-readiness` 13.4 s, `intents` 5.0 s — those three are 86 % of it). So "gate on live agents" alone would fix almost nothing — the burn sits on the project the fleet IS watching.
  - *The ask is entirely wasted.* `declared_axis_from_results` was run on every one of that project's 15 answers: **no command declares a stage axis at all** — the listing's contract ask yields `declared=None`, every cycle, forever. `_declared_stage_axis` (`fleet.py:385`) queries ALL declared commands before the axis reader gets to see the first one, so an axis nobody declares still buys the full catalogue every 30 s.
  - *No single-flight.* `api/project_status.py:_cached_query` re-spawns on TTL expiry without checking whether the same query is already running. Observed on the live server: **4 concurrent `node … set-api.mjs snapshot` children** (2–15 s old) plus 3 `history` children, under the server pid. A query slower than the TTL re-spawns itself forever.
  - *Escalation, measured.* `/api/fleet/agents` grew from 2.3–13.8 s (morning) to **33.8–40.3 s per call** (evening) with the page open — each 5 s poll stacks another handler while earlier ones still run. Trivial endpoints inherit the contention: `/api/fleet/owner` is 0.00 s in-process yet 0.4–4.0 s over HTTP; load average 9.2; the server holds 1.8 GB RSS and had burned 25 h CPU in 12 h uptime (~2 cores continuous).
  - *Second-order pollers, attributed in-process:* `/api/fleet/roster` costs **2.83 s** (`roster.read` × 21 projects = 2.68 s) and `FleetProjectColumn.tsx:1005` refetches it on every answered `/api/fleet/agents` poll — i.e. attempts every 5 s; `/api/{project}/state` costs **0.93 s** (`_enrich_changes` 0.85 s of it) and `App.tsx:41` polls it every 5 s; `useSentinelData` polls 3 sentinel endpoints every **1 s**.
  - **Revised fixed-when:** the fleet listing's axis ask becomes lazy — query in declaration order, stop at the first declarer, and when none declares (the common case) do not re-ask the catalogue on every TTL, re-scan only rarely (config change or a long TTL). Plus single-flight per (project, command) — a running query must never be re-spawned; serve the previous answer until it lands — and a duration-aware TTL so a 15 s command is not re-asked on a 30 s cycle. Pass condition unchanged: sustained sub-second `/api/fleet/agents` with the page open, and the server's concurrent-contract-child count observed at ≤1 per (project, command).
- **outcome, same day — the three mechanisms SHIPPED and verified on the live server; the burn is gone, the sub-second pass condition is not yet met, so the entry stays open:**
  - *Shipped:* lazy axis ask with a 900 s absence re-walk window and a members gate (contract work now only for projects with live agents) — `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py`; single-flight + duration-aware TTL (`_ttl_for`: cost × 10, floor 30 s, cap 600 s; failures keep the short window) — `lib/set_orch/api/project_status.py`; the roster read's 380 per-id transcript walks replaced by one index scan (`discovery.session_log_index`, selection-equivalent to `_session_log_for`, proven by a test that compares them on the same tree) — `lib/set_orch/fleet/roster.py` + `discovery.py`; the non-repo `git worktree list` warning demoted to debug. Suites: 184 passed, the one failure being pre-existing B-141.
  - *Verified on the live server, with a browser open on the fleet page:* concurrent contract children went from **4** to **0 observed over the whole measurement window**; the two 100 % CPU `bug-regression-gate` python processes are gone (they were the consumer project's own `snapshot` contract command running its fail-closed gate — spawned continuously by this endpoint's re-ask cycle, chain proven: `serve → set-api.mjs snapshot → check-bug-regression-tests.sh → python3`); **load average 9.2 → 1.8**; warm in-process endpoint cost 39 s → **0.32 s**; `roster.read` × 21 projects 2.68 s → **0.77 s**; contract subprocess duty cycle ~85 % → ~0 for this project (absence re-walk: once per 15 min).
  - *Not yet met:* `/api/fleet/agents` over HTTP still answers in ~1.5–7 s with the page open, against the sub-second pass condition. The in-process work is 0.32 s, so the adder is server-internal contention between the concurrent pollers whose per-call costs are still intrinsic — `_enrich_changes` 0.85 s, `roster.read` 0.77 s, the per-tile log reads — all on one GIL. That is the registered second-order list above; closing this entry waits on those being cheapened or de-polluted, not on the contract mechanism, which is proven.
  - *addendum, same night — the ~5 s adder narrowed to the sync threadpool, and the consumer project optimized its side:* `/api/fleet/owner` (0.00 s of work) answers bimodally 0.35 s / 3.7–4.4 s while `/docs` (async) answers in 0.5 ms — the stall lives in the sync route path. Thread states of the server with the page open: **all 40 AnyIO threadpool workers (pool capacity 40) in `hrtimer_nanosleep`** — requests queue behind sleepers. A py-spy profile of a freshly launched instance (ptrace workaround: py-spy launching the server as its own child, since ptrace_scope=1 blocks attaching) shows the same pool fully IDLE with no browser attached, and nothing pathological among the working samples — the sleeper state is produced by the browser's poll mix. The consumer project meanwhile cut its full contract cycle from 39.3 s to **14.0 s** (`snapshot` 15.0 → 3.3 s), so the once-per-15-min axis re-walk is now cheap too. Unresolved: which call the sleepers execute; the next measurement is a profile taken WHILE the page polls (py-spy launch + a headless browser driving the same endpoints), or simply an A/B with the tab closed.

### B-140 — `test_a_rename_carries_the_record_and_the_layout` expects a `carried` dict that has since gained `agent_order`; the change-detector was never updated
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-06 by this session, while running the related suites for the B-139 perf fix.
- **measured:** `pytest tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py::test_a_rename_carries_the_record_and_the_layout` fails deterministically on committed code with no local change near it: `assert answer["carried"] == {"record": 1, "docked": 1, "splits": 1}` against an actual dict that also carries `'agent_order'` — added at `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:1494` (`carried["agent_order"] = fleet_layout.relabel_agent_order(...)`) when per-project agent ordering shipped; `grep agent_order tests/unit/test_fleet_api.py` finds nothing. Same defect class as B-137's known-panel list: the exact-list detector says less than the code carries, and the suite stays red until somebody reconciles the two.
- **fixed when:** the test's expected `carried` dict names `agent_order` (with its own carried fact asserted, not just counted) and the test passes 3/3 in isolation on committed code.

### B-141 — `test_a_recorded_origin_outranks_ancestry_and_says_which_it_is` builds a hand-rolled agent stand-in that `_cache_payload` has outgrown
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-06 by this session, while running the discovery suite for the B-139 perf fix.
- **measured:** fails deterministically on committed HEAD with no local change near it (proof: the fix files stashed, the test still failed, stash restored): `AttributeError: '_A' object has no attribute 'session_log'` at `lib/set_orch/api/fleet.py:125` — `_cache_payload` now calls `read_cache_heat(agent.session_log)`, and the test's `_A` stand-in predates that field. The test docstring itself states the rule it now breaks: "A hand-listed stand-in is a second copy of `AgentState`, and this one drifted the moment the dataclass gained a field."
- **fixed when:** the stand-in is replaced by a real `AgentState` (or a complete minimal one) and the test passes 3/3 in isolation on committed code.

### B-142 — the push gate scans the NET diff of a range, so contamination sitting in an INTERMEDIATE commit's tree publishes unscanned when a whole branch goes out for the first time
- **state:** open
- **reported:** 2026-09-08 by this session, during the env-leak-gate propagation: the dry push scan of a sibling repo's 12 unpushed commits found the machine identity in a committed design doc, and working the case exposed the boundary.
- **measured:** range mode scans (a) whole files at HEAD (from the NET diff's file list) and (b) the net diff's added lines (`bin/set-leakscan`, range branch; `diff_added_lines` runs one `git diff <range>`). A line added in commit A and removed in commit C of the same range appears in NEITHER — yet `git push` of the range publishes commit A's full tree. Constructed on the actual case: the identity line sits in commit `0e16388`'s tree of the sibling's unpushed range AND at HEAD (so the existing checks block the push today); a forward-fix commit that removes the line from HEAD would make `set-leakscan --range "@{u}..HEAD"` exit 0 while the push still ships the line inside the intermediate commit's snapshot. Not published — the case was measured dry, nothing pushed.
- **fail direction:** publishes — and the gate reports clean while doing it, the exact shape the gate exists to refuse.
- **fixed when:** a first-publish range's scan covers intermediate trees — e.g. when the remote-side SHA is all zeros (first push of a ref), the env-marker/consumer-name content checks walk the range's per-commit added lines (`git log -p <base>..<head>` or per-commit `diff-tree`) instead of the net diff alone, a test holds the constructed case (leak added in A, removed in C, push refused), and the sibling-repo case itself is repaired before its next push.
