/**
 * Fleet — every agent session running on this machine.
 *
 * Two panels (task 7.1): projects on the left, the selected project's agents on
 * the right, selection without a further navigation. Cards here rather than the
 * one flat table the first draft used, because the two levels answer different
 * questions — a project is a thing you pick, an agent is a thing you read.
 *
 * Three rules this screen is shaped by, all of them measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *  - **A project tile carries enough state to be judged without selecting it**
 *    (task 7.2). Compacting must never hide a failure: if an agent inside a
 *    collapsed project is in an undetermined state, the tile says so.
 *  - **`quiet` is never rendered as "idle"** nor given a calm colour. Measured
 *    2026-08-18: the runtime flushes a turn's entries to the session log in
 *    batches, and a log was observed ~25s stale while its session was actively
 *    working. `quiet` means "no outstanding tool call as of the last flush".
 *  - **A terminal is offered exactly where one can exist, and where it cannot
 *    the tile says why** (task 8.2). The producer carries `population` as a
 *    fact, with THREE values: `started-here` has a terminal, `foreign` cannot
 *    have one, and `unknown` means the owner service could not be asked. The
 *    third is not a shade of the second — see `lib/fleetTerminal.ts`, which
 *    holds that decision as a pure function so it can be asserted in both
 *    directions.
 *
 * This is now the LANDING screen (task 7.10), which changes what the empty and
 * degraded states cost: they are the first thing a reader sees, not an edge
 * case. Hence the three-way discovery phase below (task 7.11) — *looking*,
 * *answered and empty*, and *answered* are three different screens, and a
 * failed refresh keeps the last measurement while saying how old it is rather
 * than replacing a true screen with an error.

/*
  ONE size for every branch — *"quiet main feliratok kulon fontméret?????"*,
  asked on 2026-08-19, and it was not a misreading.

  Measured from the source, not from the picture: nothing between `body` and
  this span sets a font size (`grep -n 'font-size' src/index.css` → only the
  none; the card, the grid and the title row carry no `text-*`). So these five
  branches inherited the browser default of **16px**, while the agent's NAME
  beside them is `text-sm` (14px) and its branch is `text-xs` (12px). Three
  sizes in one row, with the largest spent on the least important word.

  The size belongs here rather than on the row, because `StateLine` is rendered
  in two places — the tile and the compact row — and a size supplied by the
  caller is a second copy that drifts the moment one caller is restyled.

 * findable, not lost.
 *
 * ⚠ **One thing the row could do and a tab cannot: instruct an agent without

 * one honestly. The cost is one click — select the agent, then type into its

    THE TERMINAL OUTRANKS THE LOG — asked for 2026-08-19: *"csinaltam wpc-be egy
    uj agentet és erre megnyitotta a history log-ot és a terminalt is … ha van
    terminal nezet akkor meg az legyen!!!"*.

    Both really were open, and neither was a bug on its own. Starting an agent
    opens its terminal (`onStarted`), and `resolveLogs` opens the ENLARGED
    tile's log while no choice has been made — a default that is deliberate and
    tested. A newly started agent is both at once, so the tile stacked an empty
    log panel (*"no session log is bound to this agent"*) on top of the live
    terminal that had the answer.

    The rule is a precedence, not a removal: the log stays exactly as it was and
    comes back the moment the terminal closes. What may not happen is the two
    rendering together, because then the reader has to work out which of the two
    is the live one.

    And the control must not lie about it: `logOpen` is what is SHOWN, so the
    log icon is not lit for a panel the terminal is covering. Clicking it is an
    explicit choice and therefore outranks the default the other way — it closes
    the terminal and shows the log.

    B-61 — WHAT THE HEADER COSTS, AND WHEN.

    terminal tartalmának mert tul sok helyet elvisz felette a heder … sztem 2 sor
    kellene egy layout/agent fejlécnek összesen"*. Measured on that screenshot,
    per tile, above the terminal: a title row, a two-to-three-line `says:` block,
    a `N file(s):` line, an always-open instruction box, and then the terminal's
    own row — five to six rows of chrome for about ten rows of content.

    Two decisions get it to two, and neither of them HIDES anything the reader
    was relying on:

    - the instruction box opens from a control (see `TileControls`), because a
      box nobody has typed into is not information;
    - the `says:` block becomes ONE row: the focus takes a single line with the
      whole sentence in its tooltip, and the file NAMES — a row of their own —
      become a count on the same line, names in the tooltip. Enlarged, where
      there is room, the names come back.

    What was tried and taken back out, because it crossed from compacting into
    hiding: standing the `says:` block down entirely while the terminal or the
    log is open. It reads well — the terminal is the better answer — but the
    declared focus comes from the messaging bus and the log does NOT carry it, so
    the row is the only place that fact exists. Two rows of header plus the
    terminal's own status row is the honest arithmetic here.

    The cause was that the mark hung off the tab strip rather than off the

    project holds several agents. Measured the same day: of twelve live agents,
    the strip could carry a mark for seven.

        row back on exactly the tiles it was meant to help.

        Wrapping was the right behaviour while this half had the whole line: a
        long name pushed the icons onto a second row, and a title bar that moves
        is not a title bar. Now the icons are held by their own siblings, so the
        left half can truncate instead — the name keeps its `title`, and nothing
        here is a fact that disappears rather than shortens.

        Keyed on `terminalOpen`, which is STATE. The slot element's child count
        says the same thing and says it one render too late: the portal fills
        after this pass, and nothing would re-run to notice.

/**
 * Starting an agent — task 8.3, first half.
 *
 * Two rules shape this, and both are about not offering what does not exist:
 *
 *  - **The owner is asked first.** `GET /api/fleet/owner` answers whether an
 *    agent can be started at all, and the answer carries the reason when it
 *    cannot. A button that is present and fails is worse than one that is absent
 *    with a reason beside it — the same rule the terminal control follows.
 *  - **The label is the user's, and it is what everything else addresses.** Stop
 *    and terminal both take a label, so it is prefilled rather than generated
 *    silently: a name the reader chose is one they can find again.
 *
 * The dashboard process never forks the agent itself — it asks the owner
 * service, whose whole reason to exist is that a process started from here would
 * join this service's control group and die with the next deploy.

                  a divider drawn in the colour of the surface behind it: present,
                  and invisible for it.

                  So it is a button in the row that already answers *what is on
                  screen and how*, in the same visual language as the column
                  glyphs, and it is LIT while the panel is open — so it also says
                  whether the files are showing, which the word never did.

                  segít hogy különböző méretűek"*): a stretched row made one
                  card as tall as its tallest neighbour, so an open terminal left
                  the tile beside it a large empty box. But it fixed the ragged
                  row by handing the height decision back to each card's own
                  text, and five cards of text in an 1100 px panel is 59 % black
                  screen.
                  The floor is what stops a stretch from being emptiness: every
                  tile is at least 11rem, the excerpt grows into whatever the row
                  gives it (see `Excerpt`), and `1fr` divides the panel evenly so
                  the tiles are the same size as each other — which was the
                  original complaint. When there are more agents than fit, the

                      No `wide` any more, and the reason it existed is now fixed
                      at its source. A tile that had opened something used to
                      take the whole row, because *"a sorok megtörnek"* — one
                      tile three times the height of its neighbour left a hole
                      under the short one. The rows are UNIFORM now
                      (`auto-rows-[minmax(11rem,1fr)]`), so a tall tile cannot
                      ragged a row and the override has nothing left to fix.

                      *"column most itt a második rowt változtatta csak … és nem
                      az összeset?"* — with two of three tiles holding something
                      open, choosing three columns changed one tile and the
                      control looked broken. A layout control the reader picked
                      must not be overruled by which panels happen to be open;
                      the way to give one tile the whole panel is to maximise it,
                      which is a control the reader operates on purpose.
