/**
 * Bringing back what was here before the machine went down.
 *
 * Three placements, and only two of them are controls:
 *
 *  - **`RestoreFromEmpty`** — the panel shown when discovery answered and
 *    nothing is running. This is the PRIMARY one, and it is not the obvious
 *    choice: after a reboot no project holds an agent, so the project column
 *    offers nothing to click and a per-project control alone would be
 *    unreachable in exactly the state this feature exists for.
 *  - **`RestoreForProject`** — the per-project act, in the selected project's
 *    header, where the per-entry outcome is rendered.
 *  - the column row gets an INDICATOR only, in `FleetProjectColumn` — a count,
 *    not a button. That row already carries seven things.
 *
 * ## What the result may not do
 *
 * A restore of nine that started three is a partial result, and the single most
 * likely defect here is a green "Restored" over the six that did not come back.
 * So the outcome list is rendered where the reader is standing, every
 * non-started entry shows its reason, and the headline comes from
 * `summarise()`, which takes `complete` from the server rather than deciding it
 * a second time.

 * `summarise()`, so the partial-result rendering cannot drift into two versions.
 *
 * Why the composition rather than the record: measured 2026-08-26 on one
 * machine, the record held 233 entries against 13 that were open, because an
 * entry is keyed on the session id and a resume mints a new one. The control's
 * count was honest about what the code would do, and what the code would do was
