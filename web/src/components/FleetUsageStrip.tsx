/**
 * The account quota, on the fleet header.
 *
 * The cache-heat marks on the tabs below say what a keystroke costs. This says
 * how much is left to spend at all, and until this shipped it existed only in a
 * separate desktop window that nobody has open while watching the fleet.
 * Measured 2026-08-27: one account stood at 96 % of its 7-day window, labelled
 * `critical` by the service itself, and nothing on this screen could have said
 * so.
 *
 * ## Compact by default — and the reason is a measurement, not taste
 *
 * The first build put a full row per account under the header: names, labels,
 * sentences, 97 px of landing screen for six accounts. The user looked at it and
 * asked for the opposite (*"ez nagyon sok helyet elvisz ki kellene tenni csak a
 * mukodo statusz barokat jobbra felul optimalizalva. szovegek nem kellenek"*) —
 * the same request that turned this header's counts into icons and numbers on
 * 2026-08-19.
 *
 * So the resting state is **bars only**, on the header's own line, pushed right:
 * two stripes per account-wide window, no name, no percentage, no sentence. What
 * the words carried lives on the tooltip, and the detail is one click away.
 *
 * ## What compacting may NOT do, and this is the load-bearing half
 *
 * Every layout that hides something creates a place a broken thing can sit while
 * the screen looks calm. So the three not-a-number states do not vanish with the
 * words — they become icons and counts, which is what the request asked for:
 *
 * - `⚠ n` — windows reported critical (by their service, or banded at
 *   measurement for the source that states none — the screen does not know
 *   which, so it claims neither)
 * - `? n` — accounts that answered and carried no figures (never an empty bar:
 *   that reads as "nothing consumed", which is the opposite of what is known)
 * - `⊘ n` — accounts that did not answer at all, one cause named once
 *
 * ## It fetches its own data
 *
 * The header must render whether or not this measurement arrives, so a slow or
 * failing usage read cannot delay the counts, the project column, or the grid.
 * The same read runs again immediately after a confirmed purge, so the removed
 * rows leave the screen on the act, not on the next poll.
