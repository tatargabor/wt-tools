/**
 * The recorded fleet — what was here before the machine went down.
 *
 * Pure functions over the two roster answers, kept out of the components for
 * the reason the rest of this screen keeps them out: a restore cannot be
 * asserted in jsdom without an owner service and real processes, but the way
 * its RESULT is summarised can be, and that summary is where this feature's
 * most likely defect lives.
 *
 * ## The one rule this file exists to hold
 *
 * **A restore that did not start everything must not summarise as one that
 * did.** Nine entries of which three started is a partial result. The tempting
 * summary — "Restored 3 agents" — is true and reads as complete, which is the
 * marker-outranks-the-body defect in its most ordinary form: the count is the
 * part that gets read, and it says nothing about the six that did not come.
 *
 * So `summarise` never returns a bare success. It returns the three counts and
 * a `complete` flag taken from the SERVER's own field rather than recomputed
 * here — a second definition of "complete" would drift from the first, and the
 * copy that drifts is always the one being read.
