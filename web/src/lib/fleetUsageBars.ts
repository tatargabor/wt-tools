/**
 * What the fleet header says about the quota that actually stops the work.
 *
 * The cache-heat marks beside these answer "what does a keystroke cost here".
 * This answers the other half — "how much is left to spend at all" — and the two
 * are deliberately different measurements: one is per session and read from a
 * transcript, this one is per ACCOUNT and read from the account service.
 *
 * ## Why the strip is per account and not per tab
 *
 * A per-tab mark would claim this agent consumed this share, and that claim
 * cannot be supported. Measured 2026-08-27: of the 40 most recent session
 * transcripts on one machine, **4 carried an owning-account identity and 36 did
 * not**, and the stored account entries carry no identifier to join on. A mark
 * on 4 tabs out of 40 does not look like a coverage gap — it looks like 36
 * agents consuming nothing.
 *
 * ## Two stripes, because one is unreadable
 *
 * 60 % consumed one hour into a five-hour window is a problem; 60 % four hours
 * in is fine. A single bar cannot tell those apart, so the elapsed share is
 * drawn under the consumed share and the comparison becomes something the eye
 * does. This is the shape the desktop Control Center has used since it shipped,
 * copied on purpose: two screens showing one fact should not teach two readings.
 *
 * ## The one thing computed here rather than server-side
 *
 * **The elapsed stripe**, from `resets_at` and the window length. Everything
 * else — consumption, severity, outcome — comes from the server, so the two
 * clocks can never disagree about whether a window is critical. Elapsed is the
 * exception because it moves every second and would otherwise be exactly as
 * stale as the last poll.
 *
 * ## Absent is not zero, and it is not one state either
 *
 * `unconfigured` (no account exists), `unreachable` (it did not answer) and
 * `unmeasured` (it answered and carried no figure) are three different facts.
 * Measured the same day, one of three live accounts was in the third state —
 * `200`, both windows `null`. Drawn as an empty bar it reads as "nothing
 * consumed", which is the most confident and least true thing the strip could
 * say.
