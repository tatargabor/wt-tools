Use lowercase with dots: event.not_found, comment.invalid_body, export.unsupported_format. The SCREAMING_SNAKE convention was inherited from an old Java service and does not match our frontend error handling library. Do not change C01/C02 error codes — apply starting C03.' \

Single-item: {"ok": true, "result": {"comment": {...}}}. Action: {"ok": true, "result": {"removed": true}}. Do not use flat format like {"ok": true, "entries": [...]} — always wrap in result. This helps the frontend team distinguish payload from metadata.' \

echo 'LogBook correction (from C02 code review): For any endpoint that supports ordering, use a ?order=newest|oldest query parameter — not ?sort=desc|asc or ?sortBy=.

The fix: set busy_timeout(3000) in the database setup (in db/setup.js, right after opening the connection). This makes SQLite wait up to 3 seconds for a lock instead of failing immediately. WAL mode alone is not enough — you need busy_timeout too. We lost 2 hours debugging this.' \

With 8 characters, collision probability rises sharply above ~100K records. For any new ID generation (especially batch/bulk IDs), use nanoid(16) or longer. The existing makeId function uses nanoid(12) which is fine for entity IDs, but batch operations that create many IDs should use 16.' \

If SQL is scattered across route files, migrations become a nightmare.' \
