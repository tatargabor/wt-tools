# Worktree Management Skill

Manage git worktrees for parallel AI agent development.

## Context Detection

First, detect which mode you're operating in:

```bash
# Check if we're in a worktree (not the main repo)
if git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree &>/dev/null; then
  BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
  if [[ "$BRANCH" == change/* ]]; then
    CHANGE_ID="${BRANCH#change/}"
    echo "Running in worktree: $CHANGE_ID"
    MODE="worktree"
  else
    echo "Running in main repository"
    MODE="main"
  fi
fi
```

## Central Control Commands

Use these from the main repository to manage worktrees.

### List Worktrees

```bash
wt-list
```

List all active worktrees with their change IDs and paths.

To see remote branches available for checkout:
```bash
wt-list --remote
```

### Create New Worktree

```bash
wt-new <change-id>
```

Creates a new worktree at `../<project>-<change-id>/` with branch `change/<change-id>`.

If the branch exists on remote, it will be checked out and tracked automatically.

To force create a new branch even if remote exists:
```bash
wt-new <change-id> --new
```

### Open Worktree for Work

```bash
wt-work <change-id>
```

Opens the worktree in Zed editor with Claude Code. This launches a new agent session in that worktree context.

To open in terminal instead:
```bash
wt-work <change-id> --terminal
```

### Close Worktree

```bash
wt-close <change-id>
```

Removes the worktree. Interactive mode asks what to do with the branch:
1. Keep branch (can reopen later)
2. Delete local branch only
3. Delete local and remote branch

Non-interactive options:
```bash
wt-close <change-id> --keep-branch      # Keep the branch
wt-close <change-id> --delete-remote    # Delete both local and remote
```

### Merge Worktree

```bash
wt-merge <change-id>
```

Merges the worktree branch into the target branch (default: main/master).

Options:
```bash
wt-merge <change-id> --target develop   # Merge to specific branch
wt-merge <change-id> --no-delete        # Keep branch after merge
```

## Self-Control Commands

Use these from within a worktree to manage your own state.

### Push Current Branch

```bash
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

Pushes the current branch to remote and sets up tracking.

### Get Current Change ID

```bash
CHANGE_ID=$(git branch --show-current | sed 's|change/||')
echo "Current change: $CHANGE_ID"
```

### Close Own Worktree

From within a worktree, you cannot directly close it (the directory is in use). Instead:

1. Commit and push your changes
2. Exit the agent session
3. From main repo, run: `wt-close <change-id>`

Or instruct the user:
```
To close this worktree after I exit:
  cd <main-repo-path>
  wt-close <change-id>
```

### Merge Own Work

```bash
CHANGE_ID=$(git branch --show-current | sed 's|change/||')
wt-merge "$CHANGE_ID"
```

This will merge your current branch to the target and optionally close the worktree.

## Workflow Examples

### Central Agent: Create and Delegate Work

```bash
# List current work items
wt-list

# Create new worktree for a task
wt-new fix-login-bug

# Open agent in that worktree
wt-work fix-login-bug
```

### Worktree Agent: Complete and Hand Off

```bash
# Check current context
git branch --show-current  # -> change/fix-login-bug

# Do work...
# ...

# Push changes
git push -u origin change/fix-login-bug

# Report back to user that work is ready for merge
echo "Work complete. To merge: wt-merge fix-login-bug"
```

### Full Lifecycle

```bash
# 1. Central agent creates worktree
wt-new implement-feature

# 2. Central agent opens worktree for work
wt-work implement-feature

# 3. Worktree agent does the work, pushes
git add -A && git commit -m "Implement feature"
git push -u origin change/implement-feature

# 4. Central agent merges when ready
wt-merge implement-feature

# 5. Worktree is cleaned up automatically (or use wt-close)
```
