Timestamp: 2026-01-25
Change ID: add-control-center
Task: Test empty ralph loop
Done Criteria: manual

The Ralph loop successfully completed all 3 iterations!

Summary:
- Iteration 1: Removed unnecessary message box (commit 5f15fe8)
- Iteration 2: Created loop-test-iteration-2.txt (commit a468879)
- Iteration 3: Created this file (loop-test-iteration-3.txt)

The empty ralph loop test demonstrates that:
1. The loop runs correctly even without a tasks.md file
2. Each iteration can read context and make meaningful progress
3. The 'manual' done criteria allows the user to control when to stop
4. Commits are made atomically for each iteration's changes
