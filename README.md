# wt-tools

Autonomous multi-change orchestration for Claude Code — give it a spec, get merged features.

> **Latest update:** 2026-03-07

---

## Overview

wt-tools turns a specification document into parallel, autonomous Claude Code agents that implement, test, and merge features — while you sleep. The **sentinel** supervises the orchestrator, handles crashes, auto-approves checkpoints, and produces a summary when done. Under the hood, it decomposes your spec into independent changes, creates isolated git worktrees for each, runs Ralph loops (autonomous agent iterations), and merges results back to main with verification gates.

Beyond orchestration: **Developer Memory** gives agents persistent cross-session recall — decisions, learnings, and context accumulate across sessions so future agents don't start from zero (+34% convention compliance in benchmarks). The **Control Center GUI** shows everything at a glance: agent status, context usage, API burn rate, and orchestration progress in a compact always-on-top window.

wt-tools is modular — cherry-pick what's useful. The GUI is optional; CLI tools, Claude Code skills, memory, and the MCP server all work independently.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
git clone https://github.com/tatargabor/wt-tools.git
cd wt-tools && ./install.sh

# 2. Register your project
cd ~/my-project && wt-project init

# 3. Run the sentinel (from a Claude Code session)
/wt:sentinel --spec docs/my-spec.md --max-parallel 2

# Or start simple — create a worktree and work manually
wt-new my-feature && wt-work my-feature
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for the full guide.

## Features

**[Sentinel & Orchestration](docs/sentinel.md)** — Supervises autonomous multi-change execution. Decomposes a spec into parallel changes, dispatches each to its own worktree, monitors progress, and merges results with verification gates. [Orchestration details](docs/orchestration.md).

**[Worktrees](docs/worktrees.md)** — Git worktree management with editor integration and Claude Code auto-launch. Create, open, merge, and close worktrees from CLI (`wt-new`, `wt-work`) or from inside the agent (`/wt:new`, `/wt:merge`).

**[Ralph Loop](docs/ralph.md)** — Autonomous agent execution. Runs Claude Code in iterations through task lists, checking completion between runs. Start with `wt-loop start`, monitor with `wt-loop monitor`.

**[Developer Memory](docs/developer-memory.md)** — Per-project cognitive memory. Agents save decisions and learnings as they work — future agents recall relevant past experience automatically via 5-layer hooks. Synthetic benchmarks show +34% convention compliance.

**[Control Center GUI](docs/gui.md)** — Compact, always-on-top PySide6 window. Shows agent status, context %, API burn rate, Ralph progress, and orchestration state. Double-click to jump to any worktree.

**[Team Sync & Messaging](docs/team-sync.md)** — Cross-machine coordination without a central server. Agents see each other's status and send directed messages via a `wt-control` git branch. Experimental.

**[MCP Server](docs/mcp-server.md)** — Exposes worktree status, Ralph progress, team activity, and memory tools to Claude Code agents via Model Context Protocol.

See [CLI Reference](docs/cli-reference.md) for all commands · [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for all settings.

## Plugins

wt-tools is extensible via plugins — separate repositories that add skills, agents, hooks, or CLI commands. Plugins are deployed to a project's `.claude/` directory alongside core files. See [Plugins](docs/plugins.md) for the concept, installation pattern, and plugin registry.

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Git, Python 3.10+, jq, Node.js

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tatargabor/wt-tools.git
cd wt-tools && ./install.sh
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for GUI dependencies, platform notes, and project setup.

## Platform & Editor Support

| Platform / Tool | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| **Linux** | Primary | Tested on Ubuntu 22.04+ |
| **macOS** | Supported | Some platform-specific workarounds |
| **Windows** | Not supported | Platform stubs exist but untested |
| **Zed** | Primary editor | Best tested, recommended |
| **VS Code** | Basic support | Editor detection works, less tested |
| **Cursor / Windsurf** | Basic support | Configurable via `wt-config editor set` |
| **Claude Code** | Integrated | Auto-launch, MCP server, skill hooks |

Solo-developer project — community help with cross-platform testing is valued.
