# Cross-Cutting File Checklist

When modifying a cross-cutting file (one shared across multiple features), verify:

- [ ] Changes are additive — don't remove or rename entries other features depend on
- [ ] No duplicate keys or entries introduced
- [ ] Ordering conventions are maintained (alphabetical, grouped, etc.)
- [ ] If adding to a list/map, check for existing similar entries to avoid duplication
- [ ] Parallel changes: check if other worktrees may be modifying this same file
